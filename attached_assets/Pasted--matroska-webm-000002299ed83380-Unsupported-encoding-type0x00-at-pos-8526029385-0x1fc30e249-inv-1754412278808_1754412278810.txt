[02:28.440 --> 02:29.980]  She's already been pleased by trying to get her back.
[02:29.980 --> 02:29.980]  I'm just going to tell her that I'm not going to let her go.
[02:29.980 --> 02:29.980]  I'm just going to tell her that I'm not going to let her go.
[02:29.980 --> 02:29.980]  I'm just going to tell her that I'm not going to let her go.
[02:31.720 --> 02:33.160]  Don't bother us now, honey.
[02:33.660 --> 02:36.360]  It's only if you've been here, it's going bad and we're like a loser.
[02:36.600 --> 02:37.120]  A lot of our children.
[02:38.300 --> 02:39.880]  Oh, that poor little thing.
[02:41.500 --> 02:46.920]  Miss Goldstead told her right over the back with the rig just because she says he's getting her garden and changes her nasty old cat every day.
[02:47.160 --> 02:48.840]  70? Sorry, he's pleased.
[02:49.460 --> 02:51.020]  Oh, but he doesn't do it every day.
[02:51.440 --> 02:52.460]  Just once it's twice a week.
[02:52.840 --> 02:54.380]  And he can't catch her old cat anyway.
[02:54.820 --> 02:56.540]  And now she says she's going to get the same thing.
[02:56.540 --> 02:57.640]  We don't think we're busy.
[03:05.760 --> 03:06.580]  How's she coming?
[03:07.020 --> 03:07.680]  Hey, get easy.
[03:08.340 --> 03:10.820]  Oh, you've got my finger.
[03:11.260 --> 03:12.880]  Why don't you get your finger out of the way?
[03:14.320 --> 03:16.420]  Hey, right on my finger.
[03:16.760 --> 03:18.120]  The lucky thing it wasn't your head.
[03:18.400 --> 03:22.260]  Zeeck, what am I going to do about Miss Goldstead just because Toto chases her old cat?
[03:22.280 --> 03:24.240]  Listen, honey, I got them hugs to get in.
[03:24.240 --> 03:27.580]  Now, look at Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Goldstead.
[03:27.580 --> 03:29.060]  I think you didn't have any brains at all.
[03:29.220 --> 03:30.640]  I have so got brains.
[03:30.820 --> 03:31.740]  Well, why don't you use them?
[03:32.020 --> 03:34.220]  When you come home, don't go buy Miss Goldstead's plate.
[03:34.520 --> 03:38.500]  Then Toto won't get in her garden and you won't get in no trouble, Zeeck.
[03:38.500 --> 03:41.200]  Oh, how... you just won't listen, that's all.
[03:41.620 --> 03:43.520]  Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
[03:47.060 --> 03:49.920]  Say, get in there before I make a dime back out of you.
[03:53.300 --> 03:54.140]  Listen, Kale.
[03:55.880 --> 03:58.720]  Are you going to let that old ghost have her try and buff lawyer?
[03:59.660 --> 04:02.860]  Say it not to be afraid of having a little courage, that's all.
[04:03.360 --> 04:04.320]  I'm not afraid, Albert.
[04:04.860 --> 04:07.920]  Then the next night she swore to walk right up to her, spitting her eyes.
[04:08.220 --> 04:08.900]  That's what I do.
[04:09.400 --> 04:09.600]  Oh!
[04:10.680 --> 04:10.900]  Oh!
[04:11.980 --> 04:12.220]  Oh!
[04:12.700 --> 04:12.700]  Oh!
[04:12.820 --> 04:14.500]  Hey, hey, hey!
[04:14.500 --> 04:16.400]  I'll be out of here!
[04:16.880 --> 04:17.240]  Oh!
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.300]  Hey, are you all right, Toto?
[04:21.640 --> 04:22.820]  Yes, I'm all right.
[04:23.200 --> 04:24.680]  Oh, I feel it.
[04:25.220 --> 04:26.980]  You see...
[04:28.180 --> 04:28.980]  Why, Zeeck?
[04:29.480 --> 04:31.020]  She's the scaredest I am.
[04:31.580 --> 04:32.300]  What's the matter, girl?
[04:32.360 --> 04:34.220]  A little old pig make a coward out of you?
[04:34.720 --> 04:35.700]  Look at you, Zeeck.
[04:35.920 --> 04:36.540]  You're not just right here.
[04:36.660 --> 04:38.760]  What's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?
[04:39.200 --> 04:42.260]  I know a three-shipless farm hands will be out of a job before they know it.
[04:42.360 --> 04:43.660]  Well, Dorothy was walking around.
[04:43.680 --> 04:45.500]  I saw you chinkering with that contraption, Hickory.
[04:45.500 --> 04:47.120]  Now you and Hunk get back to that wagon.
[04:47.500 --> 04:48.320]  All right, Mrs. Gail.
[04:48.700 --> 04:51.080]  But someday they're going to erect a statue to me in this town.
[04:51.300 --> 04:53.220]  Well, don't start posing for it now.
[04:53.960 --> 04:54.700]  Here, here.
[04:54.800 --> 04:56.600]  Can't work on an empty stomach, have some crawler's.
[04:56.680 --> 04:57.320]  Gosh, Mrs. Gail.
[04:57.520 --> 04:57.960]  Just right.
[04:58.180 --> 04:58.440]  What?
[04:58.980 --> 05:01.400]  You see, Dorothy toppled in with a big door.
[05:01.460 --> 05:03.280]  It's no place for Dorothy around the pigstile.
[05:03.580 --> 05:06.180]  Now you go feed those hogs before they worry themselves into anemia.
[05:06.360 --> 05:06.640]  Yes, sir.
[05:06.900 --> 05:07.400]  And, Emi?
[05:07.880 --> 05:08.240]  Really?
[05:08.660 --> 05:09.580]  You know what, Miss Gossett?
[05:09.720 --> 05:10.820]  She was going to do the trotter?
[05:11.200 --> 05:12.060]  She says she knows.
[05:12.380 --> 05:14.140]  Dorothy, do you stop imagining things?
[05:14.140 --> 05:16.260]  You always get yourself into a friend or nothing.
[05:16.500 --> 05:20.640]  Now you just help us out today and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
[05:23.960 --> 05:26.020]  Some place where there isn't any trouble.
[05:27.560 --> 05:29.720]  I suppose there is such a place to allow.
[05:31.240 --> 05:32.300]  There must be.
[05:34.740 --> 05:38.160]  It's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train.
[05:40.340 --> 05:42.320]  It's far, far away.
[05:44.140 --> 05:47.740]  Behind the moon, beyond the rain.
[05:50.080 --> 05:58.600]  Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high.
[06:00.060 --> 06:08.360]  There's a land that I heard of once and a lullaby.
[06:11.800 --> 06:20.420]  Somewhere over the rainbow, skies all blue.
[06:22.280 --> 06:31.820]  And the dreams that you did to dream really do come true.
[06:32.820 --> 06:42.900]  Some day I wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
[06:44.900 --> 06:50.860]  Where troubles melt like lemon drops away above the chimney tops.
[06:51.320 --> 06:58.940]  That's where you are far behind me.
[07:01.340 --> 07:10.220]  Somewhere over the rainbow, over the sky.
[07:26.440 --> 07:40.200]  There's a land that I heard of once and a lullaby.
[07:40.200 --> 07:40.200]  There's a land that I heard of once and a lullaby.
[07:45.000 --> 08:10.180]  There's a land that I heard of once and a lullaby.
[08:19.680 --> 08:22.540]  I want to see you and your wife right away about Dorothy.
[08:23.220 --> 08:24.480]  Dorothy, what is Dorothy?
[08:24.700 --> 08:27.520]  She does. I'm off at lame from the right on my leg.
[08:28.200 --> 08:29.080]  Me, she bit you.
[08:29.480 --> 08:30.460]  No, her dog.
[08:31.980 --> 08:33.400]  She bit her dog, eh?
[08:35.000 --> 08:35.440]  No.
[08:37.560 --> 08:39.000]  That dog is the menace of the community.
[08:39.260 --> 08:41.120]  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
[08:42.140 --> 08:42.460]  Destroyed?
[08:42.880 --> 08:43.120]  Toto?
[08:43.840 --> 08:44.800]  Oh, you can't.
[08:44.880 --> 08:45.640]  You mustn't.
[08:46.180 --> 08:49.060]  At the end, I'll go ahead where you won't let her with you.
[08:49.620 --> 08:50.780]  Of course we won't.
[08:50.920 --> 08:52.020]  Uh, where we in?
[08:52.880 --> 08:53.560]  Please, Adam.
[08:54.680 --> 08:57.220]  Toto didn't mean to. He didn't know he was doing anything wrong.
[08:57.420 --> 08:58.540]  I'm the one that ought to be punished.
[08:58.920 --> 09:00.060]  I let him go in her garden.
[09:00.480 --> 09:02.000]  You can send me to bed without supper.
[09:02.100 --> 09:03.660]  If you don't hand over that dog, I'll bring it in.
[09:03.660 --> 09:04.820]  I'm a soup that'll take your whole farm.ERROR:core.transcription:Transcription failed for H:\Movies\1939.The.Wizard.of.Oz.dvdrip.avi.housbloke.avi: 'charmap' codec can't encode characters in position 27-29: character maps to <undefined>

[09:05.160 --> 09:07.040]  There's a law prediction, folks, against dogs that bite.
[09:07.420 --> 09:09.900]  How it'd be if she keeps him tied up, he's really gentle.
[09:10.240 --> 09:11.360]  With gentle people, that is.
[09:11.640 --> 09:13.520]  Well, that's for the sheriff to decide.
[09:14.160 --> 09:15.660]  Here's his order, allow me to take him.
[09:16.220 --> 09:17.260]  I just want to go against the law.
[09:22.040 --> 09:24.140]  I, we can't go against the law, Dorothy.
[09:24.340 --> 09:25.900]  I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
[09:26.080 --> 09:26.960]  No, you're seeing reason.
[09:27.680 --> 09:28.600]  Here's what I'm taking him in.
[09:29.200 --> 09:30.300]  So we can't attack him again.
[09:30.680 --> 09:32.440]  No, no, I won't let you take him.
[09:32.440 --> 09:33.880]  You go away.
[09:34.180 --> 09:35.500]  I'll punch him myself.
[09:35.600 --> 09:35.960]  Dorothy.
[09:36.420 --> 09:37.820]  You wicked old witch.
[09:38.360 --> 09:39.540]  I'll go handry any him.
[09:39.660 --> 09:40.600]  Go let him take him.
[09:40.720 --> 09:41.920]  Go let him take him.

[09:43.540 --> 09:44.720]  Put him in the basket, Henry.
[09:45.400 --> 09:46.180]  Yeah, I did.
[09:46.360 --> 09:47.140]  Oh, okay.

[00:20.620 --> 00:29.960]  Very long time ago, there lived a beautiful princess in a mystical land known as Indy.
[00:45.740 --> 00:56.060]  She was married to the handsome prince Rama, who had been banished to the enchanted forest by his jealous stepmother, Queen Kaike.
[01:05.100 --> 01:12.520]  One day, Princess Dita saw a wounded deer in the woods, and she begged Rama to go and help it.
[01:14.460 --> 01:24.960]  Rama drew a circle in the ground and said to her, this is a magic circle, so long as you stay inside it, no harm can come to you.
[01:28.900 --> 01:32.380]  That night, the princess heard a horrible cry.
[01:32.900 --> 01:35.060]  Ah! Help me!
[01:35.560 --> 01:41.360]  Thinking it was her beloved Rama in danger, the princess ran from the circle to answer the cry.
[01:49.900 --> 01:53.000]  She soon came across an old beggar man.
[01:54.280 --> 01:59.040]  Although she had no money to give him, she could not refuse his plea.
[02:00.520 --> 02:07.240]  As soon as he had the place laid, the sun lit, transformed into the tent-headed demon Ravana.
[02:07.240 --> 02:12.340]  He grabs the princess and takes her to his house, where he intends to make her his bride.
[02:13.840 --> 02:16.300]  Did you ever know a real prince Maya?
[02:16.880 --> 02:18.880]  Yes, lucky's father.
[02:19.300 --> 02:20.680]  I thought he was in the army.
[02:21.400 --> 02:26.440]  He was, and he was my prince, and I, his princess.
[02:27.080 --> 02:29.420]  But I mean real princes and princesses.
[02:29.880 --> 02:33.360]  All women are princesses. It is our right.
[02:35.360 --> 02:35.360]  Oh!
[02:38.540 --> 02:39.940]  Oh!
[02:45.020 --> 02:45.600]  Oh!
[02:45.600 --> 02:45.600]  Oh!
[02:45.600 --> 02:45.600]  Oh!
[02:45.600 --> 02:45.600]  Oh!
[02:45.600 --> 02:45.960]  Which way?
[02:47.260 --> 02:48.100]  Oh!
[02:50.980 --> 02:51.140]  Oh!
[02:52.180 --> 02:52.920]  Oh!
[02:54.180 --> 02:54.380]  Oh!
[02:54.860 --> 02:55.260]  Oh!
[02:57.360 --> 02:57.580]  Oh!
[02:57.580 --> 02:57.620]  Oh!
[03:07.820 --> 03:08.340]  Oh!
[03:13.460 --> 03:13.880]  Oh!
[03:13.880 --> 03:13.880]  Oh!
[03:13.880 --> 03:13.880]  Oh!
[03:13.880 --> 03:13.880]  Oh!
[03:13.880 --> 03:13.880]  Oh!
[03:13.880 --> 03:13.880]  Oh!
[03:13.880 --> 03:14.800]  I shall miss it here.
[03:15.780 --> 03:19.240]  India is the only place on earth that stirs the imagination.
[03:20.280 --> 03:22.300]  I wish we could stay here forever.
[03:22.300 --> 03:27.200]  I know, sweetheart.
[03:28.120 --> 03:32.160]  But now that England's gone to war, I must go to.
[03:32.820 --> 03:34.140]  You understand that, don't you?
[03:34.760 --> 03:36.800]  But why must I go to America?
[03:37.420 --> 03:43.200]  Because it's safer. And besides, you'll be going to the same school your mother went to when she was your age.
[03:43.760 --> 03:45.140]  And a city called New York.
[03:45.140 --> 03:45.400]  Okay.
[03:51.380 --> 03:51.860]  Papa?
[03:52.640 --> 03:55.600]  I told me that all girls are princesses.
[03:56.340 --> 03:57.820]  My, is a very wise woman.
[03:58.240 --> 03:59.020]  Then it's true.
[03:59.860 --> 04:02.640]  You can be anything you want to be my lover, as long as you believe.
[04:03.640 --> 04:04.820]  What do you believe?
[04:05.480 --> 04:10.480]  I believe that you are, and always will be my little princess.
[04:47.800 --> 04:51.200]  I gave this to your mother on a wedding day.
[04:52.380 --> 04:54.040]  I want you to have it.
[04:56.460 --> 04:57.940]  You're so beautiful.
[05:00.480 --> 05:02.380]  What did you love most about her?
[05:04.360 --> 05:05.180]  Tough question.
[05:09.740 --> 05:11.780]  I love the way her eyes looked at once you loved.
[05:12.620 --> 05:13.620]  Just like yours do.
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.780]  I love the sound of a voice, which it sang me the Indian folk song.
[05:20.040 --> 05:26.100]  But I think, and all that anything else, I loved dancing with that.
[05:43.620 --> 05:44.000]  I love you.
[05:51.660 --> 05:52.460]  I love you.
[05:55.260 --> 05:55.460]  Thank you.
[05:55.460 --> 05:58.080]  Thank you.
[05:58.620 --> 06:00.260]  How many fans more on the night?
[06:01.540 --> 06:02.220]  I'm sorry.
[06:02.220 --> 06:02.220]  I'm sorry.
[06:04.460 --> 06:05.000]  I'm sorry.
[06:11.820 --> 06:13.220]  I'm sorry.
[06:14.200 --> 06:14.640]  I'm sorry.
[06:36.940 --> 06:37.600]  Hello.
[06:38.680 --> 06:40.340]  You must be Captain Crew.
[06:44.300 --> 06:46.440]  My sister will be down presently.
[06:46.800 --> 06:48.760]  We were just preparing the young lady's room.
[06:49.400 --> 06:51.100]  Your beautiful things arrived this morning.
[06:51.520 --> 06:51.840]  Thank you.
[06:52.560 --> 06:54.220]  Oh, heavens, Amelia.
[06:54.780 --> 06:55.600]  Amelia mentioned.
[06:56.840 --> 06:57.940]  Captain Crew.
[07:10.900 --> 07:12.760]  So delightful to meet you.
[07:14.680 --> 07:16.500]  And this must be little Sarah.
[07:17.480 --> 07:19.400]  My what a beautiful child.
[07:19.860 --> 07:20.720]  I was just telling you.
[07:20.740 --> 07:22.020]  Thank you, Amelia. That will be all.
[07:23.000 --> 07:24.580]  Now, won't you both follow me?
[07:27.240 --> 07:29.300]  Classes begin promptly at eight o'clock.
[07:29.620 --> 07:31.860]  We cover all the subjects, literature and math.
[07:31.860 --> 07:34.440]  Science and, of course, both French and Latin.
[07:35.020 --> 07:36.420]  Oh, well, Sarah speaks fluent.
[07:36.640 --> 07:39.300]  And it's served at 130 after which you take our 84.
[07:40.040 --> 07:42.480]  Unless the closer we're going to scream the incline.
[07:43.420 --> 07:45.960]  Before the clock, we throw the 10 classes at etiquette.
[07:46.240 --> 07:49.540]  But there are personally trained all the former French to sign.
[07:50.880 --> 07:54.800]  Study hall is between 430 and 630, followed by a light supper.
[07:55.380 --> 07:58.240]  And then, before bedtime, we read from one of the classics.
[07:58.240 --> 08:01.160]  Something the children always look forward to a great anticipation.
[08:02.000 --> 08:03.080]  Sunday is a day of rest.
[08:03.300 --> 08:05.000]  Students are allowed to write only to their parents.
[08:05.380 --> 08:06.560]  And, of course, we attend church.
[08:07.140 --> 08:07.760]  How do you any questions?
[08:19.880 --> 08:21.060]  Come on, Amelia.
[08:31.740 --> 08:33.340]  Oh, I'm going to eat.
[08:33.660 --> 08:34.620]  I'm going to eat.
[08:34.660 --> 08:36.140]  You're in one city, Farge.
[08:36.820 --> 08:40.320]  Girls, I would like you to say hello to our new arrival.
[08:40.900 --> 08:41.860]  Miss Sarah Crew.
[08:42.420 --> 08:43.620]  Hello, Sarah.
[08:44.620 --> 08:47.180]  You must tell them all about your exciting life in India.
[08:48.000 --> 08:50.760]  No doubt you'll be our most popular student in no time.
[08:51.640 --> 08:55.200]  Now, there are certain rules that should be made quite clear.
[08:55.200 --> 08:56.760]  The first is the Water Rule.
[09:26.900 --> 09:29.320]  These rules are strictly enforced.
[09:30.080 --> 09:33.700]  But I can assure you, Captain Crew, the results are well worth the effort.
[09:34.420 --> 09:41.460]  Our reputation for sending the most poised and charming young ladies into society is one of the highest.
[09:42.340 --> 09:42.840]  I have no doubt.
[09:44.640 --> 09:49.560]  Also, I'm afraid dual reans at such finery are not allowed.
[09:50.040 --> 09:52.320]  What if I were to my room during my free time?
[09:53.320 --> 09:56.240]  Well, have you absolutely enceased?
[09:59.320 --> 09:59.980]  I did.
[10:01.080 --> 10:03.500]  She's going to get so much trouble.
[10:08.820 --> 10:09.620]  Miss Sarah?
[10:10.560 --> 10:11.240]  Jeanage.
[10:12.320 --> 10:12.660]  Jeanage.
[10:18.320 --> 10:19.960]  This is splendid.
[10:21.360 --> 10:22.960]  It's our largest suite.
[10:23.740 --> 10:25.760]  Thank you for all the care you've had in this mission.
[10:26.840 --> 10:29.520]  I once I feel as much as I can as possible while I'm away.
[10:30.460 --> 10:30.880]  No expense.
[10:31.180 --> 10:31.760]  I should be spared.
[10:32.020 --> 10:32.880]  Of course not.
[10:33.620 --> 10:34.960]  Now, I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
[10:35.660 --> 10:37.780]  I know you don't have much time before you're both leaves.
[10:52.800 --> 10:54.400]  We ride to each other every day.
[11:02.580 --> 11:03.520]  How do you like your room?
[11:04.680 --> 11:08.520]  I made sure it was the best corner windows and a fireplace.
[11:10.080 --> 11:12.300]  And with all your toys and clothes we moved in,
[11:13.540 --> 11:14.960]  it's just as if you were really...
[11:18.760 --> 11:22.720]  You know, I think I saw something on that chair over there.
[11:27.360 --> 11:29.740]  She came all the way from France just to be with you.
[11:32.940 --> 11:33.800]  My name is Emily.
[11:37.060 --> 11:37.440]  Emily.
[11:40.620 --> 11:42.580]  You know, dolls make the very best friends.
[11:42.580 --> 11:45.780]  Just because they can't speak.
[11:46.460 --> 11:47.540]  Doesn't mean they don't listen.
[11:48.960 --> 11:52.040]  And did you know that when we lived about that room,
[11:52.640 --> 11:53.200]  they come to life?
[11:53.580 --> 11:54.020]  They do?
[11:54.360 --> 11:54.520]  Yes.
[11:55.300 --> 11:56.620]  But before we walk in and catch them,
[11:56.780 --> 11:58.640]  they return to their places quick as lightning.
[11:59.520 --> 12:02.480]  Why don't they come to life and find us so we can see them?
[12:02.880 --> 12:03.740]  Because it's magic.
[12:06.140 --> 12:07.380]  Magic has to be believed.
[12:08.500 --> 12:09.700]  That's the only way it's real.
[12:13.060 --> 12:14.120]  Whenever you're afraid,
[12:14.940 --> 12:15.620]  or miss me terribly,
[12:16.580 --> 12:17.460]  just tell Emily,
[12:19.320 --> 12:21.760]  you should get a message to me wherever I am.
[12:23.720 --> 12:24.980]  And then I'll send one back right away,
[12:26.400 --> 12:27.920]  so that when you hug her,
[12:30.140 --> 12:31.500]  you'll really be getting a hug from me.
[12:40.440 --> 12:43.360]  So right, that...
[12:44.100 --> 12:45.920]  ...is going to be fine.
[12:54.700 --> 12:55.760]  What are you doing?
[12:58.100 --> 12:59.480]  Memorizing me by heart.
[13:00.480 --> 13:00.940]  No.
[13:02.320 --> 13:04.580]  I'm not even going to know you by heart.
[13:25.080 --> 13:26.320]  Goodbye, princess.
[14:01.100 --> 14:01.960]  That's nothing.
[14:02.180 --> 14:03.880]  She's here to Josephine's snore.
[14:04.340 --> 14:04.780]  I bet.
[14:05.600 --> 14:06.240]  I do not.
[14:07.220 --> 14:08.780]  Who wasn't the new girl?
[14:09.580 --> 14:11.160]  She has a clav'er, Juliet.
[14:11.700 --> 14:13.200]  Did you see all of her toys?
[14:13.780 --> 14:15.500]  I want your hair in it.
[14:15.680 --> 14:17.540]  The father goes cracker to something.
[14:17.960 --> 14:18.900]  They're very rich.
[14:19.160 --> 14:19.840]  They must be.
[14:20.120 --> 14:21.580]  Everyone I know eats crackers.
[14:22.220 --> 14:23.040]  The father's British.
[14:23.580 --> 14:25.360]  I heard his best friends were picking green.
[14:25.600 --> 14:25.760]  Huh.
[14:26.700 --> 14:28.540]  Well, I heard he was thrown out of India
[14:28.540 --> 14:30.900]  because people died for waiting his poison crackers.
[14:31.640 --> 14:32.560]  Poison crackers.
[14:33.280 --> 14:34.200]  Poison crackers?
[14:34.960 --> 14:37.640]  I once had an aunt who died for meeting poisonous string beans.
[14:37.880 --> 14:39.000]  Oh, who cares about her?
[14:39.340 --> 14:40.500]  Yeah, who cares.
[14:45.180 --> 14:47.020]  But before we walk in and catch them,
[14:47.380 --> 14:49.260]  they return to their places quicker-like thing.
[14:50.300 --> 14:51.420]  Gosh, he's fast.
[15:04.500 --> 15:04.940]  Mama.
[15:07.280 --> 15:07.720]  Sarah.
[15:08.520 --> 15:10.500]  We're not accustomed to delaying everyone's breakfast
[15:10.500 --> 15:11.180]  or one student.
[15:11.460 --> 15:13.200]  I'm sorry, miss Minchin, but I've been...
[15:13.200 --> 15:14.420]  They're not the only child here, Sarah.
[15:14.560 --> 15:15.340]  You must remember that.
[15:15.980 --> 15:18.220]  Ah, von Joroman, so do you fudge.
[15:18.580 --> 15:19.820]  Come on, debt below, you do it.
[15:20.080 --> 15:22.160]  No, yes, yes, yes.
[15:22.740 --> 15:23.300]  Good morning.
[15:23.620 --> 15:25.740]  I trust you remember our newest pupil for my visit.
[15:25.740 --> 15:25.740]  I'm sorry, miss Minchin.
[15:25.740 --> 15:25.740]  But I've been...
[15:25.740 --> 15:25.740]  You're not the only child here, Sarah.
[15:25.740 --> 15:26.680]  What's your class yesterday?
[15:27.320 --> 15:28.620]  Sarah, this is Minchin, you fudge.
[15:29.020 --> 15:30.880]  You will begin French lessons with him this afternoon.
[15:31.340 --> 15:32.500]  Do I have to?
[15:32.940 --> 15:35.040]  Sarah, you must certainly do.
[15:35.880 --> 15:38.440]  Now, apologize to Minchin, this is instantly your rudeness.
[15:38.720 --> 15:39.940]  But I didn't mean to be rude.
[15:40.280 --> 15:40.520]  Now.
[15:45.880 --> 15:47.680]  Monsieur, je regrette.
[15:48.420 --> 15:49.920]  Mais je sais parler frantais.
[15:50.640 --> 15:52.500]  J'ai tout de laie en ende avec mon pFre.
[15:52.500 --> 15:55.880]  Pour moi, je n'ai pas une petite une petite une avec mon pFre.
[15:56.180 --> 15:56.660]  Oh...
[15:56.660 --> 15:59.020]  Next child doesn't need to learn French.
[15:59.440 --> 16:01.060]  She practically is French.
[16:01.660 --> 16:03.220]  She said she learnt it from her father.
[16:03.720 --> 16:05.780]  I understood perfectly well what she said, Monsieur.
[16:06.040 --> 16:07.960]  I'm sorry, but we tried to tell you.
[16:08.200 --> 16:10.380]  Well, perhaps she can tutor the younger children.
[16:10.620 --> 16:12.440]  And she might just be able to help you
[16:12.440 --> 16:14.740]  with your pronunciation, Miss Minchin.
[16:15.820 --> 16:17.900]  Are those sausages I spanned?
[16:19.100 --> 16:19.580]  Oh...
[16:31.980 --> 16:33.040]  Thank you.
[16:33.580 --> 16:36.380]  Sarah, you're no talking at the table.
[16:37.640 --> 16:39.040]  Doesn't seem natural.
[16:41.660 --> 16:43.100]  I won't say it again.
[16:51.400 --> 16:54.400]  Seven times five is thirty-five.
[16:54.900 --> 16:57.100]  Seven times six is forty-two.
[16:57.500 --> 16:59.040]  Seven times seven is forty-nine.
[16:59.700 --> 17:02.760]  Seven times eight is fifty-eight.
[17:04.260 --> 17:05.260]  No way.
[17:06.000 --> 17:06.700]  Fifty-four?
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.160]  Um, uh, fifty-five?
[17:10.160 --> 17:13.060]  Seven or seventy-two, or ninety-three, or twelve?
[17:13.760 --> 17:15.320]  I'm sorry, Miss Minchin.
[17:16.100 --> 17:18.060]  I studied for hours last night.
[17:18.360 --> 17:20.120]  I find that very hard to believe.
[17:20.960 --> 17:23.000]  And I imagine your father will as well.
[17:23.600 --> 17:25.340]  Please don't tell Miss Minchin.
[17:26.160 --> 17:27.360]  I promise all the better.
[17:28.080 --> 17:28.540]  Please.
[17:29.660 --> 17:31.020]  Levenia, you may continue.
[17:32.060 --> 17:34.420]  Seven times eight is fifty-six.
[17:35.420 --> 17:39.400]  Seven times nine is sixty-three.
[17:40.120 --> 17:42.200]  Seven times five is thirty-five.
[17:43.020 --> 17:45.100]  Seven times six is forty-two.
[17:48.360 --> 17:51.240]  Dear Papa, I miss you already.
[17:52.320 --> 17:56.960]  Things are fine, except I never imagined there would be so many rules at school.
[17:57.820 --> 18:01.960]  I guess they're there for a purpose, and I'm trying hard to obey them.
[18:01.960 --> 18:04.780]  But I get the feeling I'm doing something wrong.
[18:21.960 --> 18:23.060]  Good life, Father.
[18:23.800 --> 18:23.980]  John.
[18:25.960 --> 18:26.460]  Very sorry.
[18:41.400 --> 18:46.240]  I hope when you read this, it kindles your heart, and puts a smile on your face.
[18:47.220 --> 18:53.120]  Papa, I'm so proud of you, and I think about you every moment, and I love you forever.
[18:54.340 --> 18:55.200]  You're a Sarah.
[19:07.600 --> 19:08.620]  No, no, no.
[19:08.860 --> 19:10.260]  You mustn't get so upset.
[19:10.800 --> 19:11.040]  You're lying.
[19:11.320 --> 19:11.660]  Pressure?
[19:12.300 --> 19:14.200]  Oh, please, lie down.
[19:14.620 --> 19:15.820]  Please stop screaming.
[19:16.600 --> 19:17.560]  I've got a cooking.
[19:18.480 --> 19:19.060]  Would you like that?
[19:20.360 --> 19:21.960]  No, no, no.
[19:24.500 --> 19:25.200]  No, no, no.
[19:30.280 --> 19:31.400]  No, no.
[19:31.400 --> 19:33.560]  I want to study with you carrying on like this.
[19:33.600 --> 19:34.620]  I want my mom.
[19:35.200 --> 19:36.380]  You'll see her soon.
[19:36.700 --> 19:40.300]  Now I love you dad, and I want every tear I get.
[19:41.440 --> 19:43.560]  I don't have a mother either.
[19:47.180 --> 19:48.300]  You don't?
[19:50.120 --> 19:51.200]  Where is she?
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.320]  In heaven, with my baby sister.
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.240]  But that doesn't mean I can't talk to her.
[19:57.780 --> 19:58.780]  I tell her everything.
[19:58.780 --> 20:00.920]  I know she hears me.
[20:01.040 --> 20:01.640]  How?
[20:03.380 --> 20:05.240]  Because that's what angels do.
[20:05.700 --> 20:09.840]  Your mom and angel, of course, and so is yours.
[20:10.700 --> 20:16.720]  Beautiful wings of silk and a crown of baby rose buds, and they all live together in a castle.
[20:17.760 --> 20:18.880]  Do you know what it's made of?
[20:20.740 --> 20:22.440]  Sunflowers, hundreds of them.
[20:23.220 --> 20:24.980]  So bright they shine like gold.
[20:26.280 --> 20:31.000]  And when the angels want to go someplace, they just whistle like this.
[20:37.900 --> 20:41.640]  And a cloud floats to the castle door and picks them up.
[20:42.580 --> 20:44.560]  And if the angels fly through the sky,
[20:45.840 --> 20:50.900]  riding a cloud like a magic carpet under the moon and through the stars.
[20:55.100 --> 20:57.180]  Until they're hovering right above us.
[21:00.640 --> 21:03.220]  That's how they can look down and see if we're all right.
[21:05.640 --> 21:08.740]  And sometimes they even send messages to us.
[21:11.600 --> 21:16.320]  Of course, you can't hear the messages if you're kicking and screaming as loudly as you were.
[21:17.760 --> 21:21.560]  But they always try again, just in case we've missed it.
[21:24.980 --> 21:26.120]  Hey, where is?
[21:27.900 --> 21:30.760]  That's Betty. She's not allowed to talk to us.
[21:31.060 --> 21:35.380]  Why not? She's a servant girl and she has skirt skips.
[21:36.140 --> 21:36.620]  So?
[21:37.360 --> 21:39.780]  Well, does that mean something?
[22:23.520 --> 22:24.200]  I'm sorry.
[22:24.460 --> 22:24.960]  I didn't mean to do that.
[22:24.960 --> 22:24.960]  I'm sorry.
[22:24.960 --> 22:24.960]  I'm sorry.
[22:24.960 --> 22:26.420]  I mean, I don't know if I can do anything I can do for you, Miss.
[22:27.360 --> 22:29.120]  I just came up here to change my shoes.
[22:29.980 --> 22:31.860]  No, no, there's nothing.
[22:32.360 --> 22:34.060]  Well, then, making a party.
[22:34.840 --> 22:36.740]  But we'll both be in trouble if you stay.
[22:42.000 --> 22:43.260]  All right, girls.
[22:43.900 --> 22:44.400]  Pair up.
[22:46.720 --> 22:47.640]  Pair up.
[22:54.960 --> 22:56.860]  It won't disdain for Christmas.
[22:57.200 --> 22:57.920]  It's still so small.
[22:58.500 --> 23:01.260]  It won't go far and it won't go far.
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.140]  It's still so small.
[23:04.500 --> 23:05.140]  Hey, where's the girl?
[23:05.780 --> 23:06.460]  She's a servant girl and she has skirt skips.
[23:06.460 --> 23:06.460]  It's still so small.
[23:07.240 --> 23:08.460]  It's still so small.
[23:09.700 --> 23:11.460]  And she has skirt skips.
[23:21.100 --> 23:21.800]  It's still so small.
[23:24.960 --> 23:25.400]  I'm sorry.
[23:37.920 --> 23:40.640]  Sir Edward saw the sorrow in his daughter's eyes,
[23:40.960 --> 23:43.820]  but he knew that family honor must prevail at all costs.
[23:44.620 --> 23:46.700]  Nobility was not a thing to be trifled with.
[23:47.200 --> 23:48.920]  I beg of you, Charlotte, you said.
[23:49.580 --> 23:51.960]  Mary served John in the spring as he has asked.
[23:52.640 --> 23:53.440]  Thank you, Lavinia.
[23:54.400 --> 23:54.880]  Sorry.
[23:54.940 --> 23:54.940]  I'm sorry.
[23:54.940 --> 23:54.940]  I'm sorry.
[23:54.940 --> 23:55.740]  May we take your turn?
[24:07.660 --> 24:09.740]  Charlotte turned to her father and said,
[24:10.260 --> 24:11.180]  Father, you are right.
[24:11.580 --> 24:14.660]  I must put away my foolish fancies and childhood wishes.
[24:24.940 --> 24:26.480]  But I simply won't do it.
[24:26.940 --> 24:30.000]  I'm sorry, Father, but when I marry it will be for love.
[24:30.580 --> 24:32.860]  And with that, Charlotte ran from the house.
[24:33.740 --> 24:36.620]  Waiting outside for her was the handsome stable boy here,
[24:37.120 --> 24:38.560]  who Charlotte secretly adored.
[24:39.100 --> 24:42.100]  Together, they escaped to the coast and quickly set sail
[24:42.100 --> 24:43.320]  to the island of Tahiti.
[24:43.760 --> 24:47.500]  But when they were halfway there, their ship was attacked by a band of pirates.
[24:48.880 --> 24:53.480]  Rather than be eaten alive, Charlotte and Pierre threw themselves into the raging sea.
[24:53.480 --> 24:58.680]  And as they began to drown, they held each other close and swore their undying love.
[25:00.860 --> 25:05.580]  But then, when all seemed lost, a group of mermaids appeared and rescued.
[25:05.680 --> 25:05.840]  Stop!
[25:10.720 --> 25:12.200]  What are you doing?
[25:13.320 --> 25:17.880]  I couldn't bear to see Charlotte marry that awful man, so I imagined a different ending.
[25:18.120 --> 25:19.060]  You imagined it.
[25:20.420 --> 25:22.400]  Don't you ever do that, miss Minchin?
[25:22.400 --> 25:25.240]  Believe in something just to make it seem real?
[25:28.600 --> 25:31.200]  I suppose that's rather easy for Charlotte who has everything.
[25:32.380 --> 25:35.520]  But from now on, there will be no more make-believe at this school
[25:35.520 --> 25:37.520]  during reading out or at any other time.
[25:38.160 --> 25:38.800]  Is that understood?
[25:39.380 --> 25:41.220]  Yes, miss Minchin.
[25:41.420 --> 25:42.980]  Now all of you go to your bed, this instant.
[25:47.760 --> 25:50.460]  I never heard a story like that in my whole life.
[25:50.460 --> 25:52.980]  I bet you know lots of them.
[25:53.520 --> 25:54.140]  Don't you Sarah.
[25:55.000 --> 25:56.760]  I want silence up there.
[25:58.680 --> 26:01.700]  I have to do something about this communication role.
[26:03.140 --> 26:08.960]  Hey, after Minchin goes to bed, we'll sneak into a room and you can see how the real story is.
[26:09.260 --> 26:10.640]  Yeah, how about it Sarah?
[26:11.280 --> 26:12.740]  Well, only if it's just you three.
[26:13.240 --> 26:14.760]  Come on, come on.
[26:33.120 --> 26:36.740]  Come on, come on.
[26:59.540 --> 27:03.380]  The evil Ravana locked the prince up in his palace tower.
[27:03.760 --> 27:08.140]  There she stayed for many weeks, just staring at her window,
[27:08.840 --> 27:10.540]  missing her prince Rana Terrible.
[27:18.680 --> 27:20.000]  I'm sure Papa,
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.180]  just be triacontont double-blood.
[27:23.360 --> 27:27.460]  I'm a jewel of Papa, just be triacontont double-blood.
[27:29.440 --> 27:29.960]  Perfect.
[27:31.240 --> 27:32.720]  You look just like Emily.
[27:34.820 --> 27:36.180]  My father hates dolls.
[27:37.300 --> 27:40.400]  And he hates coming here so as he doesn't belong.
[27:41.660 --> 27:42.860]  And what does he say to you?
[27:43.960 --> 27:45.300]  Because he wants to meet a ball of horror.
[28:01.200 --> 28:02.020]  Zacoro
[28:09.980 --> 28:11.280]  So much.
[28:11.440 --> 28:13.940]  It looks like she just really sees me.
[28:14.400 --> 28:16.200]  Another little girl.
[28:16.200 --> 28:17.980]  She's so rich.
[28:18.420 --> 28:19.100]  She's rich.
[28:19.920 --> 28:20.560]  She speaks.
[28:21.180 --> 28:22.580]  Oh, she's totally rich.
[28:22.820 --> 28:24.000]  No mother and I are very proud.
[28:24.520 --> 28:25.820]  We're going to cut a busy next time.
[28:27.400 --> 28:29.960]  Oh, sweet, honey.
[28:30.900 --> 28:32.760]  Oh, sweet, honey.
[28:32.760 --> 28:35.120]  I cut you, Daddy.
[28:35.640 --> 28:39.600]  You look so pretty.
[28:40.580 --> 28:42.200]  You look so pretty.
[28:42.200 --> 28:42.940]  That was important.
[28:43.940 --> 28:43.980]  Yeah.
[28:46.740 --> 28:47.020]  Oh.
[28:49.120 --> 28:50.020]  Oh, my goodness.
[28:50.860 --> 28:52.200]  Oh, my goodness.
[28:53.220 --> 28:53.720]  Oh, my goodness.
[28:54.160 --> 28:55.860]  Oh, my goodness.
[28:55.860 --> 28:55.860]  Yeah.
[28:59.200 --> 29:00.140]  Daddy.
[29:03.160 --> 29:04.100]  Daddy.
[29:04.240 --> 29:04.240]  Daddy.
[29:04.240 --> 29:04.720]  Daddy.
[29:04.740 --> 29:04.740]  Daddy.
[29:37.040 --> 29:42.180]  Oh, my goodness.
[29:42.200 --> 29:42.200]  Oh, my goodness.
[29:48.500 --> 29:49.380]  Randolph.
[29:50.080 --> 29:50.720]  John.
[29:54.240 --> 30:00.080]  Mama approached the thorny palate, unaware that Ravana was waiting for it.
[30:00.400 --> 30:03.220]  Oh, my, my, my, my.
[30:11.480 --> 30:12.120]  That's it.
[30:12.560 --> 30:13.660]  I can't take it anymore.
[30:14.120 --> 30:15.860]  I don't care what you say about Sarah's stories.
[30:16.280 --> 30:18.580]  They've got to be more fun than watching your hair being combed.
[30:20.560 --> 30:24.220]  If anyone else feels the same way, I think she should leave, too.
[30:32.760 --> 30:33.200]  I think she should leave, too.
[30:33.200 --> 30:33.200]  I think she should leave, too.
[30:33.200 --> 30:33.200]  I think she should leave, too.
[30:33.200 --> 30:33.200]  I think she should leave, too.
[30:33.200 --> 30:35.200]  Come on.
[30:38.500 --> 30:41.140]  But the evil Ravana was not through yet.
[30:41.760 --> 30:45.940]  This time he took a bow that could hold not one, but 10 arrows.
[30:46.480 --> 30:48.100]  Each filled with a deadly poison.
[30:48.520 --> 30:50.340]  The arrows fed through the arrow.
[30:50.980 --> 30:52.440]  Heading straight for Ravana.
[30:53.360 --> 30:54.680]  And the arrows hit the ground.
[30:55.160 --> 30:56.880]  I'm released there poison.
[30:57.560 --> 31:00.520]  Shia clouds of thick yellow smoke.
[31:08.560 --> 31:09.960]  Oh.
[31:13.700 --> 31:13.700]  Oh.
[31:16.520 --> 31:17.600]  Oh.
[31:19.740 --> 31:19.920]  Oh.
[31:20.180 --> 31:21.000]  Oh.
[31:21.380 --> 31:21.620]  Oh.
[31:22.380 --> 31:22.740]  Oh.
[31:22.740 --> 31:22.740]  Oh.
[31:23.440 --> 31:23.580]  Oh.
[31:23.580 --> 31:26.520]  Heading straight for Ravana.
[31:30.500 --> 31:30.500]  Oh.
[32:04.460 --> 32:10.520]  I'm not a big P! I'll rush up, buddy. I'm sure Princess Sarah will give everyone a fair share.
[32:11.140 --> 32:18.360]  Right, Princess? I told her that's what you were. Well, not just me. All girls are princesses.
[32:18.860 --> 32:21.640]  Even Snottie two-faced bullies like you, Lavanya.
[32:30.500 --> 32:35.120]  I have a hand! I have a hand! I have a hand! I have a hand! I have a hand!
[32:35.380 --> 32:43.940]  I have a hand! You get it!
[32:43.940 --> 32:52.460]  Miss Minchin? Yes. May I help you?
[32:52.880 --> 32:56.500]  I'm Mr. Barrow. Captain Cruz Lissiter.
[32:57.560 --> 32:59.400]  Oh, yes! You're amazing.
[33:03.680 --> 33:05.860]  We've just celebrated Little Sarah's birthday.
[33:06.020 --> 33:10.420]  May I speak to you in private? Oh, yes, of course. Right this way.
[33:42.800 --> 33:47.360]  May I just say, Mr. Barrow, that Sarah is quite the favorite around here.
[33:47.700 --> 33:51.000]  You went to Great Lakes to make this a special day for her.
[34:04.040 --> 34:08.000]  I'm afraid your check to us this month will be rather large.
[34:08.300 --> 34:12.800]  There will be no check, Miss Minchin. Excuse me?
[34:39.360 --> 34:40.760]  Oh!
[35:02.500 --> 35:07.180]  The party is over. I will never want to go to their rooms this instant.
[35:07.460 --> 35:12.220]  Miss Minchin. Sarah, you will stay behind. I have something to tell you.
[35:13.900 --> 35:14.200]  Move!
[35:22.500 --> 35:25.420]  Amelia, go to Sarah's room and find a simple black dress.
[35:25.860 --> 35:27.920]  If she has nothing suitable, Barrow won't come to me.
[35:28.380 --> 35:29.900]  What's Mr. I... Do as I say.
[35:57.980 --> 36:00.120]  I'm afraid I have some bad news, Sarah.
[36:02.720 --> 36:05.300]  Your father has...
[36:07.740 --> 36:08.980]  Your father...
[36:10.140 --> 36:12.920]  It's been discovered that your father has died.
[36:14.600 --> 36:16.460]  He was killed in battles several weeks ago.
[36:19.060 --> 36:23.200]  I'm sorry, but that's the reality of the situation.
[36:23.200 --> 36:25.360]  There's nothing anyone can do to change it.
[36:27.540 --> 36:32.160]  But more, the British government has seized control of his company and all of his assets,
[36:32.800 --> 36:35.080]  leaving you panellists without any money.
[36:36.140 --> 36:39.480]  And since you have no relations to speak of, this puts me in a terrible position.
[36:42.660 --> 36:43.720]  What are you staring at?
[36:45.320 --> 36:49.840]  Don't you understand what I'm saying? You are alone in the world.
[36:52.220 --> 36:56.460]  Unless I decide to keep you here, out of charity.
[37:07.880 --> 37:11.820]  Because of the expenses you've incurred, everything you own now belongs to me.
[37:12.400 --> 37:14.660]  Your clothes, your toys, everything.
[37:15.300 --> 37:18.460]  Though it will hardly make up for the financial losses I have suffered.
[37:19.480 --> 37:22.100]  From now on, you must earn your room and board here.
[37:22.600 --> 37:25.820]  You will move to the attic with Becky and work as a servant.
[37:27.740 --> 37:31.460]  If you fail to meet the standards of this institution or if you don't do as you're told,
[37:32.020 --> 37:32.720]  they'll be thrown out.
[37:33.540 --> 37:37.580]  And they'll leave me, Sarah. The streets of this city are not kind to homeless beggars.
[37:43.120 --> 37:46.300]  You should be part of the Mabel in the kitchen promptly at 5 a.m.
[37:49.880 --> 37:52.000]  I could have your arrested for taking this.
[37:53.940 --> 37:55.500]  You're lucky I let you keep that doll.
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.940]  You may have the book, but another incident like this.
[38:00.920 --> 38:02.160]  And I will call the authorities.
[38:05.060 --> 38:07.280]  I expect you to remember Sarah Crue.
[38:07.720 --> 38:09.300]  You're not a princess any longer.
[39:02.160 --> 39:02.160]  I'm sorry.
[39:20.220 --> 39:20.860]  Papa.
[39:25.160 --> 39:25.520]  Papa.
[39:27.880 --> 39:29.280]  Papa.
[39:29.280 --> 39:32.060]  Papa.
[39:33.860 --> 39:35.260]  Papa.
[39:41.580 --> 39:42.980]  Papa.
[39:44.120 --> 39:44.980]  Papa.
[39:49.680 --> 39:51.080]  Papa.
[39:51.080 --> 39:51.220]  Papa.
[39:51.760 --> 39:53.160]  Papa.
[39:55.100 --> 39:56.500]  Papa.
[39:56.500 --> 39:57.540]  Papa.
[39:57.540 --> 39:57.540]  Papa.
[40:08.340 --> 40:09.020]  Papa.
[40:19.080 --> 40:19.760]  Papa.
[40:19.760 --> 40:19.760]  Papa.
[40:19.760 --> 40:19.760]  Papa.
[40:19.760 --> 40:19.760]  Sarah.
[40:20.420 --> 40:20.960]  What happened?
[40:21.280 --> 40:24.520]  Sarah. You deserve the girls without conversation.
[40:24.920 --> 40:25.300]  Do you understand?
[40:26.920 --> 40:29.800]  Sarah will be working here as a servant from now on.
[40:30.320 --> 40:32.400]  There will be no communication exchanged.
[40:33.240 --> 40:33.800]  Is that clear?
[40:34.480 --> 40:35.400]  Yes, please.
[40:37.260 --> 40:39.580]  Madame, I'm a fan of her.
[41:17.120 --> 41:25.280]  I'm a fan of her.
[41:25.280 --> 41:25.280]  I'm a fan of her.
[41:25.280 --> 41:25.280]  I'm a fan of her.
[41:26.700 --> 41:27.740]  I'm going to go.
[41:27.740 --> 41:28.660]  Here, my son.
[41:30.340 --> 41:31.880]  I'm going to go.
[41:32.980 --> 41:34.520]  I'm going to go.
[41:35.740 --> 41:38.280]  I'm going to go.
[41:39.720 --> 41:40.640]  Let go!
[41:43.180 --> 41:44.220]  This!
[41:45.020 --> 41:47.480]  I'll check, but I can't.
[41:48.000 --> 41:48.380]  I can't.
[41:48.700 --> 41:49.480]  I can't.
[42:11.300 --> 42:12.700]  I can't.
[42:12.700 --> 42:21.120]  Oh my god!
[42:21.640 --> 42:22.800]  It can't be.
[42:23.800 --> 42:24.660]  It's my son, John!
[42:25.260 --> 42:26.140]  Oh dear, John!
[42:27.760 --> 42:28.780]  It's John!
[42:29.220 --> 42:29.720]  John!
[42:31.500 --> 42:32.340]  You know what I mean?
[42:33.600 --> 42:35.180]  You know what I mean?
[42:35.720 --> 42:36.480]  I'm going to go.
[42:36.520 --> 42:36.740]  I'm going to go.
[42:43.440 --> 42:46.940]  Oh, I thought you'd be sleeping.
[42:46.940 --> 42:52.480]  John, I never got a chance to give you your birthday present.
[42:55.480 --> 42:57.400]  It's a picture where you used to live.
[42:58.220 --> 42:59.100]  See the blue threads?
[43:00.000 --> 43:00.880]  That's the river.
[43:02.720 --> 43:05.200]  And these are the mountains you always talk about.
[43:06.340 --> 43:07.180]  Thank you, Becky.
[43:08.560 --> 43:09.620]  It's beautiful.
[43:14.180 --> 43:16.800]  Sarah, why don't you tell your stories anymore?
[43:17.760 --> 43:18.960]  Just make play.
[43:19.560 --> 43:20.640]  I don't mean it.
[43:21.600 --> 43:23.920]  Oh, but they've always meant something to me.
[43:25.340 --> 43:28.920]  They were days I thought I would die until I heard you talk about the magic.
[43:30.300 --> 43:32.240]  There is no magic, Becky.
[43:53.380 --> 43:57.260]  Papa, can you hear me?
[43:59.520 --> 44:00.840]  I'm so scared.
[44:13.300 --> 44:19.420]  I'm so scared.
[44:38.060 --> 44:40.460]  Sarah, are you still a princess?
[44:42.200 --> 44:45.320]  You better get back in line or we'll both be in trouble.
[44:46.100 --> 44:46.920]  Are you?
[44:47.460 --> 44:47.820]  Laughty!
[44:50.380 --> 44:51.960]  All right, girls, get in line.
[45:17.200 --> 45:18.280]  Don't touch that.
[45:18.640 --> 45:20.080]  The Mr. Raddle, next door.
[45:20.700 --> 45:21.500]  Poor man.
[45:22.400 --> 45:24.680]  His son is missing an action over in Europe, you know.
[45:24.840 --> 45:25.400]  You mean John?
[45:26.000 --> 45:27.420]  Oh, he's such a nice boy.
[45:28.400 --> 45:29.700]  Yeah, very nice, very fresh.
[45:30.340 --> 45:30.820]  You're a good boy.
[45:30.820 --> 45:30.820]  I'm so happy to see you.
[45:30.820 --> 45:32.840]  You have to take it.
[45:33.140 --> 45:34.860]  You have to take it.
[45:35.740 --> 45:38.260]  You have to take it.
[45:38.900 --> 45:40.780]  Hello, girl.
[45:42.340 --> 45:43.760]  I told you to give her away.
[45:48.360 --> 45:49.400]  Excuse me.
[45:51.220 --> 45:53.000]  You see, you'll never get rid of them.
[45:54.540 --> 45:54.940]  No.
[45:58.020 --> 45:59.140]  May I help you?
[46:03.720 --> 46:05.140]  Would you like to buy a flower?
[46:06.860 --> 46:08.420]  Would you like to buy a flower?
[46:08.780 --> 46:12.260]  No, thank you, sir.
[46:12.960 --> 46:14.200]  Would you like to buy a flower?
[46:14.200 --> 46:15.160]  One flower.
[46:17.760 --> 46:20.280]  Would you like to buy a flower?
[46:21.360 --> 46:25.980]  Without you, I'd have bought a new one.
[46:29.080 --> 46:30.500]  Would you like to buy a flower?
[46:31.980 --> 46:33.000]  Would you like to buy a flower?
[46:35.860 --> 46:36.980]  Would you like a flower?
[46:38.100 --> 46:38.700]  Pardon me?
[46:38.840 --> 46:39.600]  Would you like a flower?
[46:46.020 --> 46:46.800]  Or...
[46:46.800 --> 46:47.780]  Get her a flower.
[46:48.740 --> 46:49.440]  Wait!
[46:57.240 --> 46:58.160]  For the princess.
[47:02.000 --> 47:03.220]  Do you like to buy a flower?
[47:03.860 --> 47:04.340]  No, sir.
[47:05.620 --> 47:07.440]  It's a beautiful flower.
[47:07.440 --> 47:10.040]  I'm sure you're going to hate me, though.
[47:11.680 --> 47:17.680]  Oh, I want to hate you, though I hate you.
[47:17.700 --> 47:20.520]  I want to love you.
[47:25.560 --> 47:28.500]  I want to see you.
[47:28.700 --> 47:28.820]  I want to see you.
[47:28.820 --> 47:31.360]  I want to see you.
[47:31.500 --> 47:36.800]  I want to see you.
[47:36.800 --> 47:42.140]  Got your love in your hands?
[47:42.140 --> 47:43.800]  It's a beautiful flower.
[47:44.580 --> 47:47.880]  It's a beautiful flower.
[47:48.800 --> 47:52.800]  I want to see you.
[48:06.800 --> 48:06.800]  So....
[48:29.280 --> 48:30.680]  Finally..
[48:32.820 --> 48:36.760]  What is it, Little Mouse? Are you a prisoner too?
[48:40.780 --> 48:43.320]  Is it ever this cold when you come from?
[48:44.740 --> 48:45.220]  No.
[48:47.080 --> 48:48.640]  Tell me about it, sir.
[48:49.660 --> 48:51.240]  Tell me again about India.
[48:56.800 --> 49:00.100]  India, tell me.
[49:00.240 --> 49:08.640]  Well, the air is so hot there, you can almost taste it.
[49:09.660 --> 49:12.480]  I bet it tastes like coconuts.
[49:13.120 --> 49:15.880]  No. It's more like spices really.
[49:17.280 --> 49:19.240]  Curry and saffron.
[49:19.240 --> 49:20.880]  What else?
[49:25.200 --> 49:31.740]  Tigers sleep under trees and elephants cool themselves in the lakes.
[49:32.480 --> 49:38.180]  Warm wind blows through the fields and the spirits ride in.
[49:39.360 --> 49:44.620]  Singing as they look down on us, their voices echo through the mountains.
[49:44.620 --> 49:52.900]  The sky, the small different colors like peacocks do.
[49:52.900 --> 50:07.900]  The sun is shining and the sun is shining with your heart into my heart.
[50:49.920 --> 50:52.720]  The sun is shining and the sun is shining with your heart into my heart.
[50:52.720 --> 50:52.820]  The sun is shining and the sun is shining with your heart into my heart.
[51:17.740 --> 51:22.220]  Singing as they look down on us, their voices echo through the mountains.
[51:22.220 --> 51:22.800]  Singing as they look down on us, their voices echo through the mountains.
[51:22.800 --> 51:33.600]  The sun is shining and the sun is shining with your heart into my heart.
[51:33.620 --> 51:38.600]  With your heart into my heart.
[51:54.800 --> 51:59.240]  Start all over the place to come before we get out of my house.
[51:59.440 --> 52:02.940]  And you can forget being paid this way.
[52:04.240 --> 52:06.800]  Who are you don't?
[52:07.240 --> 52:10.400]  I told you I wouldn't tolerate this life a bit of sutt in this house.
[52:10.820 --> 52:13.700]  And there, just look at my food. It's filthy.
[52:15.440 --> 52:19.860]  Now, now, take this ridiculous fucking thing with you.
[53:24.800 --> 53:26.860]  Where might Mr. Millie be this morning?
[53:27.440 --> 53:28.660]  Good morning, Francis.
[53:29.180 --> 53:30.260]  Look at her early this morning.
[53:30.880 --> 53:34.780]  I'm working on an scout to get up early if he wants to have an affect on the world.
[53:35.340 --> 53:35.760]  How, too?
[53:37.020 --> 53:39.060]  In what a powerful affect you have, Francis.
[54:18.640 --> 54:19.800]  Where have you been?
[54:20.820 --> 54:22.500]  I've been chilled for almost half an hour.
[54:22.980 --> 54:24.080]  Hurry up and light a fire.
[54:25.260 --> 54:28.060]  And make sure not to touch anything else with your dirty hands.
[54:28.600 --> 54:29.820]  This is my room now.
[54:30.400 --> 54:32.020]  And I won't have you messing it up.
[54:35.720 --> 54:36.200]  Ugh!
[54:37.020 --> 54:38.720]  What is that awful smell?
[54:39.460 --> 54:41.400]  When was the last time you had a bath?
[54:47.360 --> 54:47.760]  Riksha!
[54:48.120 --> 54:48.840]  No, you're not.
[54:49.100 --> 54:49.760]  What are you doing?
[54:50.740 --> 54:51.140]  Shakambad!
[54:51.240 --> 54:51.880]  I don't believe it.
[54:52.160 --> 54:53.340]  I'm not going to sue.
[54:53.600 --> 54:54.600]  So you just stop it.
[54:54.600 --> 54:54.800]  Yes!
[54:55.260 --> 54:56.060]  Stop it, I'm shane!
[55:01.580 --> 55:02.780]  What did you just do?
[55:03.400 --> 55:05.940]  Just a little curse I learned from a witch back in India.
[55:05.940 --> 55:06.900]  Curse?
[55:07.840 --> 55:08.380]  Ha!
[55:09.520 --> 55:10.860]  What kind of curse?
[55:11.360 --> 55:11.820]  You'll see.
[55:12.840 --> 55:15.000]  But I won't brush my hair as much if I will you.
[55:27.980 --> 55:28.880]  It's all right.
[55:29.500 --> 55:31.060]  I saved it especially for you.
[55:31.060 --> 55:32.840]  Come on.
[55:33.360 --> 55:34.060]  Thank you.
[55:47.740 --> 55:49.140]  Oh!
[55:57.120 --> 55:57.720]  Oh!
[55:59.800 --> 56:01.340]  Is this where you live?
[56:02.000 --> 56:03.480]  You shouldn't be here, my God.
[56:04.040 --> 56:04.760]  It's too dangerous.
[56:05.400 --> 56:08.320]  Sarah, why don't you like me anymore?
[56:08.940 --> 56:10.240]  Did I do something wrong?
[56:10.720 --> 56:12.100]  No, of course not.
[56:12.720 --> 56:14.900]  I didn't think you'd want me for a friend.
[56:15.380 --> 56:19.120]  Now that things are different, Sarah needs to be with you.
[56:19.120 --> 56:19.120]  I'm sorry.
[56:19.120 --> 56:19.120]  I'm sorry.
[56:19.120 --> 56:19.120]  I'm sorry.
[56:19.120 --> 56:19.120]  I'm sorry.
[56:19.120 --> 56:19.120]  I'm sorry.
[56:19.120 --> 56:19.120]  I'm sorry.
[56:19.120 --> 56:19.120]  I'm sorry.
[56:19.120 --> 56:19.440]  I know.
[56:19.920 --> 56:23.040]  I'm sure you could take just one without me for a friend,
[56:23.240 --> 56:25.800]  but I couldn't keep one without you.
[56:26.420 --> 56:27.020]  Oh, my God.
[56:27.520 --> 56:28.380]  I'm sorry.
[56:28.800 --> 56:30.940]  I should have known you wouldn't be like the others.
[56:31.860 --> 56:32.640]  What's that?
[56:33.140 --> 56:34.520]  One knock means I'm here.
[56:36.160 --> 56:38.000]  Two knocks means all as well.
[56:39.240 --> 56:41.680]  Three knocks means the coast is clear.
[56:42.180 --> 56:43.820]  The demon mentioned lead is asleep.
[56:44.240 --> 56:46.280]  Gosh, you're also so adventurous.
[56:46.280 --> 56:48.820]  Look, Becky, we haven't visited.
[56:49.560 --> 56:50.620]  Hello, Becky.
[56:52.460 --> 56:55.320]  Oh, Sarah, I miss your story so much.
[56:56.020 --> 56:58.680]  Won't you tell us what happened to Grandma and the princess?
[56:59.760 --> 57:04.160]  The smoke from Ravana's arrows finally began to lift.
[57:05.680 --> 57:07.540]  Grandma, he died on the ground.
[57:08.120 --> 57:12.580]  No, but then a wonderful thing happened.
[57:13.200 --> 57:18.080]  The gazelle laid out next to Ravana, giving him his own life.
[57:29.520 --> 57:31.820]  He is suffering from acute amnesia,
[57:32.420 --> 57:34.340]  one of the rare side effects of poison gas.
[57:35.580 --> 57:36.760]  His eyes will heal in time.
[57:37.360 --> 57:39.620]  His memory, you can say.
[57:40.220 --> 57:41.320]  He's not my son.
[57:44.060 --> 57:45.520]  I'm sorry, Mr. Randolph.
[57:46.960 --> 57:51.260]  He was found in severe shock with no coat, no identification.
[57:52.480 --> 57:54.500]  Since your son was the only name unaccounted for,
[57:55.140 --> 57:56.800]  they assume this must be John.
[57:59.280 --> 58:00.260]  I am sorry.
[58:09.980 --> 58:12.380]  All the hoping, you must think me a fool.
[58:13.960 --> 58:15.780]  Is it your wish to be wise, Sarah?
[58:16.640 --> 58:17.580]  I don't know.
[58:19.320 --> 58:22.260]  I suppose why is man wouldn't have come here at all?
[58:22.900 --> 58:26.680]  But if he had, he would have looked more closely upon the soldier's face.
[58:29.500 --> 58:30.680]  What would he have seen?
[58:31.540 --> 58:34.620]  He said, he needs to be cared for.
[58:36.660 --> 58:38.140]  He's not my responsibility.
[58:38.140 --> 58:42.060]  A wise man would remember that this soldier was in John's regiment.
[58:42.880 --> 58:44.120]  If his memory returns,
[58:45.040 --> 58:47.280]  he might tell Saheb what happened to his son.
[58:49.880 --> 58:53.580]  Perhaps Saheb will learn that John is in British hospital now,
[58:54.260 --> 58:58.900]  wishing that a kind man would take him home away from his pain.
[59:03.600 --> 59:05.420]  The plumber comes while I'm at the bank,
[59:05.420 --> 59:06.220]  showing the problem.
[59:08.620 --> 59:13.140]  Oh, and make sure the Latin test is corrected by the time I get back.
[59:13.440 --> 59:14.320]  Yes, sister.
[59:20.060 --> 59:21.360]  Hello, Miss Mention.
[59:23.560 --> 59:24.840]  Goodbye, Miss Mention.
[59:51.080 --> 59:52.140]  I'll go, buddy.
[59:52.220 --> 59:52.580]  Again.
[59:57.140 --> 59:57.860]  Again.
[59:57.860 --> 59:58.360]  I'll go, buddy.
[59:58.660 --> 59:59.160]  Again.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:02.800]  Again.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:02.800]  Again.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:05.400]  Again.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:05.400]  Again.
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:19.500]  Let's find my bag.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.000]  Ah!
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:26.120]  Come on, get me a towel.
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:31.180]  Ah!
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.260]  Ah!
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:46.220]  Ah!
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:49.760]  Ah!
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:52.620]  Ah!
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.000]  Zaryk, come quick.
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:56.800]  It's Lonnie.
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:57.860]  I think she'll be zasht.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.160]  Ah!
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.600]  I got it.
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:37.040]  Will you please get that child under control?
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.320]  You have to worry about everything's fine.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:09.440]  Well, what is it?
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.920]  I thought I saw a mouse.
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:45.620]  I swear that child has a pact with Satan to destroy me.
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.380]  I'm just not coming out for this job.
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:51.780]  I have no patience for children and teaching all those horrible facts to remember.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.240]  I don't like it at all.
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.740]  You like Francis, though, don't you?
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:57.020]  What?
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.040]  Of course not.
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:00.540]  How dare you.
[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:02.360]  I think you like C2.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.820]  Do you do?
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.480]  Really?
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:10.200]  I think you should run away together and get married.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.360]  It'd be terribly romantic.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.640]  Wouldn't you store anything to say?
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:17.720]  Hi.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:19.880]  Hi.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:29.260]  Well, anyway, my sister would be furious if she found out.
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:37.180]  So you'd be long gone by then, living in some exotic paradise with that dashing young milkman.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.020]  Oh, better get to the market.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.640]  You're doing well, young man.
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:06.400]  You're almost home.
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.180]  You must trust my eyes, sir.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.380]  What's going on?
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.960]  It's a surprise.
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:48.500]  What are you doing here?
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:49.800]  We brought you something.
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:57.620]  Princess Sarah, we'd like to present you with something we rescued.
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:59.240]  In a most dangerous place.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:00.080]  A dangerous adventure.
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.620]  A very young crusade.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.280]  Risking all our lives.
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:04.380]  And mine too.
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:14.240]  I don't know what to say.
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:21.360]  Well, the best friends anyone could ever ask for.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.120]  It's alright.
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.000]  It's just my little monkey friend.
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:29.080]  Hanneman.
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:32.580]  Where did he come from?
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:34.020]  Right next door.
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:34.780]  Look.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.160]  Hanneman likes to come and visit me all the time.
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:40.240]  Can you really talk to him, Sarah?
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:41.080]  Sure.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.820]  Hanneman, say hello to all my friends.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:11.360]  After Rama came back to life, you raced on towards the monster's palace to rescue Sita.
[01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:14.920]  And suddenly, we're brought up here.
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:32.640]  I think we better save the rest of the story for later.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.460]  What's going on here?
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.220]  It's not the fall.ERROR:core.transcription:Transcription failed for H:\Movies\A little princess.avi: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u043e' in position 33: character maps to <undefined>

[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.480]  I asked them to come.
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.200]  You five, get downstairs immediately.
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:57.600]  I'll deal with you later.
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:02.620]  Becky, you will remain locked in your room for the entire day.
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:02.620]  I'll be back.
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:02.620]  I'll be back.
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:02.620]  I'll be back.
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:02.620]  I'll be back.
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:04.640]  Go.
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:13.860]  And you will perform all her chores and additions to your own without breakfast, lunch or dinner.
[01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:16.020]  It's time you learn, Sarah.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:22.700]  It's a cruel, nasty world out there.
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:25.160]  And it's hard to make the best of it.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:30.700]  Not to indulge in ridiculous dreams, but to be productive and useful.
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:36.160]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:40.700]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:43.420]  Good.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.200]  But I don't believe in it.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:54.940]  Don't tell me you still fancy yourself a princess.
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:58.180]  Good God, Chad, look around you.
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.180]  Or better yet, look in the mirror.
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:10.180]  I am a princess.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.640]  All girls are.
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:15.100]  Even if they live in tiny old attics.
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:17.480]  Even if they dress in rags.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.680]  Even if they are pretty or smart or young.
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:24.220]  They're still princesses.
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:25.820]  All of us.
[01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:29.160]  Didn't your father ever tell you that?
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:31.040]  Didn't he?
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:39.760]  If I find you up here with any of the girls again, I will throw you out into the street!
[01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:14.300]  What are we going to do?
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:17.920]  A whole day with nothing to eat.
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:19.560]  Don't cry, Becky.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:21.600]  I'm scared.
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:23.780]  If mention throws me out.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:24.200]  I'm scared.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:24.200]  I'm scared.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:24.200]  I'm scared.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:24.200]  I'm scared.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:24.200]  I'm scared.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:24.200]  I'm scared.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:24.200]  I'm scared.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.660]  I got no place to go.
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:27.800]  It's not true.
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:29.840]  I'm here with you.
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:33.020]  I always thought of us as sisters.
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:34.780]  You have?
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:36.960]  Let's make a promise right now.
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.900]  To always look out for each other.
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:40.060]  It's a promise.
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:45.760]  Now, what are we going to do about food?
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:47.820]  Star, I guess.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.240]  No, there's only one thing to do.
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:54.360]  We'll eat a great feast before we go to sleep.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.980]  And that will keep us full all day tomorrow, feast.
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.360]  What feast?
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:01.520]  Just look around.
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.060]  Do you see that table over there?
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:12.180]  It's covered with a beautiful cloth and candles and trays and trays of good things to eat.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.140]  Come on, Becky.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.680]  Tell me what kind of food there is.
[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:21.620]  I don't see any food.
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:22.740]  Try, Becky.
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:25.000]  Just make the leave it.
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.580]  Remember what you told me about the magic?
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:38.780]  Muffins?
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:39.640]  Good.
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:40.820]  What kind?
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:42.100]  All kinds.
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.820]  Every kind of muffin God ever made.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:47.300]  And all of them hot.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:48.040]  Good.
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:54.180]  We're not dressed right for such a long and big one.
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:01.480]  I'm wearing a long velvet cape with fur on the collar.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:02.800]  How about you?
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:09.840]  Well, I always like diamonds myself, rings and bracelets and a whole dress just covered with them.
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:14.360]  Smell the sausage.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.800]  Oh, I love sausages.
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:09.820]  I love sausages.
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:24.040]  This isn't a cookie mein.
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:24.040]  Sure enough, Becky.
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:25.540]  Ah!
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.000]  Becky!
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:39.820]  Becky!
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:40.080]  Jackie!
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.760]  Oh my lord!
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:51.120]  I think you want a little too far this time.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.060]  It wasn't me!
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.080]  Go ahead.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:58.080]  Okay.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.320]  Feel like I've been touched by an angel.
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:15.340]  Look!
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:17.440]  Just what we ordered.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.440]  I'm a little scared about all of this.
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:21.880]  Me too.
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:23.940]  You think we shouldn't date it?
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:25.240]  I'm not that scared.
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:38.600]  I'm not scared.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.560]  Thank you for all your kindness.
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.600]  I'm so sorry to inconvenience you.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:42.900]  It is nothing, say.
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:50.940]  That word...
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.380]  It sounds so familiar.
[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:54.340]  Yeah.
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:56.380]  I don't know what it means.
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.280]  It is not English.
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:00.160]  We use it where I am from.
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:02.440]  In India.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:07.240]  India...
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:07.720]  You know it?
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:11.760]  No.
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.860]  Everything is just a blur.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.600]  Maybe Sunday I'll sort it all out.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.700]  You will, say.
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:25.360]  You will.
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:26.380]  You will.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:20.360]  l will have to make it faster.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.800]  You'll know.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:37.520]  Come, little mobsome animal.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:37.520]  I'm fine with this.
[01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:51.040]  Oh, it's such a big trouble for you.
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:02.560]  Oh!

[05:34.840 --> 05:34.940]  What?
[05:35.180 --> 05:35.760]  What?
[05:35.760 --> 05:36.540]  What?

[05:51.400 --> 05:52.060]  What?
[05:55.080 --> 05:55.480]  I'm going to get you.
[05:57.060 --> 05:58.400]  I'm going to get you.
[06:00.100 --> 06:01.220]  I'm going to get you.
[06:01.800 --> 06:02.880]  Oh, no.
[06:03.560 --> 06:04.700]  Oh, no.
[06:04.940 --> 06:05.560]  Oh, no.
[06:07.220 --> 06:11.200]  You're going to be in trouble, right?
[06:12.100 --> 06:12.900]  What?
[06:13.480 --> 06:14.700]  I'm going to get you.
[06:17.160 --> 06:17.200]  What?
[06:17.960 --> 06:17.960]  Oh, no.
[06:18.260 --> 06:18.520]  Stop it.
[06:18.520 --> 06:19.600]  You're going to be in trouble.
[06:22.620 --> 06:24.220]  Oh, no.
[06:24.480 --> 06:24.480]  You're going to be in trouble.
[06:24.480 --> 06:24.480]  Oh, no.
[06:24.480 --> 06:24.480]  Don't shout.
[06:25.100 --> 06:25.880]  Something's wrong.
[06:26.860 --> 06:28.880]  You're going to be in trouble.
[06:29.220 --> 06:30.260]  Something's wrong.
[06:30.620 --> 06:31.060]  You're going to be in trouble.
[06:31.320 --> 06:32.120]  Enough.
[06:32.120 --> 06:32.760]  It's so much fun.
[06:33.060 --> 06:35.100]  I can't do this.
[06:35.120 --> 06:36.880]  I can't do this.
[06:37.000 --> 06:37.300]  I can't do this.

[06:40.020 --> 06:40.280]  ...
[06:40.280 --> 06:40.940]  It's good that theijis mustn't live in work.
[06:42.220 --> 06:45.080]  There must be something to keep the sun rising.
[06:49.460 --> 06:51.880]  Your warriors are the ones survived.
[06:52.500 --> 06:56.680]  You've regained your words to do it.
[06:56.680 --> 06:57.260]  They've gone ahead and told you that.
[06:58.000 --> 07:02.420]  But they might've killed him toothpicks his forehead
[07:04.460 --> 07:06.100]  That's why they are still fryin'
[07:06.820 --> 07:08.340]  Will that stop it?

[01:58.040 --> 01:58.900]  I'll pass it to you.
[01:59.040 --> 01:59.560]  I'll pass it to you.
[01:59.980 --> 01:59.980]  I'll pass it to you.
[02:12.200 --> 02:17.320]  I'll pass it to you.
[02:41.720 --> 02:59.860]  I'll pass it to you.
[03:09.180 --> 03:17.320]  I'll pass it to you.
[03:35.280 --> 03:36.980]  I'll pass it to you.
[03:59.980 --> 04:06.980]  I'll pass it to you.
[04:29.980 --> 04:34.020]  I'll pass it to you.
[05:06.760 --> 05:11.320]  I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st Street on the 11th floor.
[05:12.600 --> 05:16.180]  My name is Patrick Bateman. I'm 27 years old.
[05:18.020 --> 05:23.740]  I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine.
[05:25.040 --> 05:29.960]  In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach cramping.
[05:29.960 --> 05:32.400]  I can do a thousand now.
[05:50.040 --> 05:53.800]  After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pour cleanser lotion.
[05:54.800 --> 05:57.980]  In the shower, I use a water activated gel cleanser.
[05:59.640 --> 06:05.620]  Then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub.
[06:15.240 --> 06:21.780]  Then I apply an herb mint facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.
[06:24.740 --> 06:32.180]  I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.
[06:33.180 --> 06:39.980]  Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm, followed by final moisturizing protective lotion.
[06:41.160 --> 06:51.860]  There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory.
[06:52.860 --> 07:02.000]  And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable.
[07:02.920 --> 07:06.040]  I simply am not there.
[07:22.600 --> 07:24.580]  I want you to stay.
[07:30.820 --> 07:34.000]  Morning, Elf.
[07:34.160 --> 07:34.840]  Nice to meet you.
[07:40.340 --> 07:42.880]  The real week's class. Sorry. Any messages?
[07:43.500 --> 07:46.620]  Rick and Harrison has to cancel. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
[07:47.060 --> 07:50.240]  Occasionally, Box with Rick at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
[07:50.240 --> 07:53.060]  Spencer wants to meet for drinks at Foudys, your 17.
[07:53.320 --> 07:55.920]  When? After six. Negative, cancel it.
[07:56.320 --> 07:59.460]  And what should I say? Just say no. Just say no.
[08:00.920 --> 08:07.860]  Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at camels at 12.30, and if not there, try crayons, alright?
[08:08.100 --> 08:15.200]  Sir? Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at 8 o'clock on Thursday.
[08:16.460 --> 08:17.340]  Something romantic?
[08:18.340 --> 08:18.780]  No.
[08:21.300 --> 08:24.260]  Silly. Forget it. I'll make them.
[08:24.380 --> 08:24.860]  No, I'll do it.
[08:25.260 --> 08:28.260]  No, no. Be a doll and just get me a mineral water, okay?
[08:29.620 --> 08:30.520]  You look nice today.
[08:31.300 --> 08:32.560]  Don't wear that outfit again.
[08:32.900 --> 08:34.100]  What? I didn't hear you.
[08:34.460 --> 08:39.080]  I said, do not wear that outfit again. Wear a dress or skirt or something.
[08:39.860 --> 08:41.060]  You don't like this, I take it.
[08:41.320 --> 08:41.680]  Come on.
[08:42.520 --> 08:43.620]  You're prettier than that.
[08:44.460 --> 08:45.500]  Thanks Patrick.
[08:46.180 --> 08:50.840]  I'm not here. I'm high heels. I like high heels.
[08:59.840 --> 09:01.140]  Feathered friends for 600.
[09:01.600 --> 09:06.560]  During courtship, the male frigate bird in place to enormousize the red pouts found here.
[09:07.320 --> 09:10.760]  She's a breeze, you know I see the powerful force.
[09:10.960 --> 09:14.160]  You're the wind of the fall, when it's known to us.
[09:14.520 --> 09:17.720]  She's a little cut to me, but now I'm better.
[09:22.060 --> 09:25.340]  Thousands of roses and lots of chocolate triples.
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.600]  Good either. And it works just on the hatch out.
[09:28.820 --> 09:33.100]  I'm trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer tape, but Evelyn, my supposed fiance,
[09:33.620 --> 09:34.700]  keeps buzzing in my ear.
[09:34.700 --> 09:35.400]  I'm going to take a little bit of the time first.
[09:36.200 --> 09:38.580]  Any leave of it. We'll get any leave of it.
[09:39.240 --> 09:41.140]  And we'll have to get someone to videotape.
[09:43.060 --> 09:44.320]  Patrick, we should do it.
[09:45.960 --> 09:46.760]  Do what?
[09:47.480 --> 09:48.520]  Get married, have a wedding.
[09:49.000 --> 09:50.440]  No, I can't take the time off work.
[09:50.640 --> 09:53.380]  Before the practically owns the company, you can do anything you'd like silly.
[09:53.640 --> 09:54.600]  I don't want to talk about it.
[09:55.020 --> 09:58.000]  I hate that job anyway. See what you just don't quit.
[09:58.980 --> 10:02.080]  Because I want to fit in.
[10:05.040 --> 10:06.640]  Simply resist the fall.
[10:11.660 --> 10:13.240]  Simply resist the fall.
[10:13.720 --> 10:14.580]  Wait inside.
[10:15.740 --> 10:18.620]  I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at a spa.
[10:18.900 --> 10:21.360]  Since I'm positive, we won't have a decent table.
[10:22.040 --> 10:22.920]  But we do.
[10:23.760 --> 10:26.600]  And relief washes over me in an awesome way.
[10:26.720 --> 10:29.860]  Patrick, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend, Stash.
[10:30.260 --> 10:30.580]  Who do you mind?
[10:31.300 --> 10:31.840]  I'm Emma Harris.
[10:32.320 --> 10:33.220]  I'm Edie from Brown.
[10:33.220 --> 10:34.200]  I see a lot of you.
[10:34.500 --> 10:35.180]  Oh.
[10:37.400 --> 10:38.080]  OK.
[10:38.960 --> 10:39.860]  Hey, all right.
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.900]  I'm fairly certain that Timothy Bryson Evelyn are having an affair.
[10:45.920 --> 10:48.280]  Timothy is the only interesting person I know.
[10:48.840 --> 10:53.480]  I'm almost completely indifferent as to whether Evelyn knows I'm having an affair
[10:53.480 --> 10:56.840]  with Courtney Robinson, her closest friend.
[10:57.780 --> 10:59.260]  Courtney is almost perfect looking.
[11:00.380 --> 11:03.380]  She's usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs tonight.
[11:03.380 --> 11:04.540]  I believe it's Xanax.
[11:05.400 --> 11:10.180]  More disturbing than her drug use though is the fact that she's engaged to Lewis Carothers.
[11:10.900 --> 11:12.420]  The biggest doofus in the business.
[11:12.680 --> 11:13.740]  Tell me, Stash.
[11:14.900 --> 11:18.020]  Do you think so how is becoming too commercial?
[11:18.540 --> 11:18.760]  Yes.
[11:19.380 --> 11:20.020]  I read that.
[11:20.240 --> 11:21.400]  Who gives a rat's ass?
[11:21.560 --> 11:23.120]  OK. That affects us.
[11:23.340 --> 11:23.560]  Oh.
[11:24.180 --> 11:26.300]  Well, what about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey?
[11:26.300 --> 11:27.880]  That's not effective, too.
[11:28.000 --> 11:29.520]  Do you know anything about Sri Lanka?
[11:30.120 --> 11:32.420]  The Sikhs are killing tons of Israelis over there.
[11:32.660 --> 11:33.400]  Come on, Bryce.
[11:34.160 --> 11:38.140]  There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about Nakhwat.
[11:38.440 --> 11:46.520]  We have to end a partite for one and slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism, and world hunger.
[11:46.900 --> 11:54.180]  We have to provide food and shelter for the homes and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights
[11:54.180 --> 11:57.180]  while also promoting equal rights for women.
[11:57.800 --> 12:03.220]  We have to encourage our return to traditional moral values.
[12:04.180 --> 12:11.900]  Most importantly, we have to promote general social concern, unless materialism and young people.
[12:15.080 --> 12:17.660]  Patrick, how far promote you?
[12:54.180 --> 12:54.840]  Hello?
[12:57.180 --> 12:58.060]  Hello.
[12:58.060 --> 12:58.060]  Hello.
[12:58.980 --> 13:00.160]  Hello.
[13:04.060 --> 13:04.860]  Hello.
[13:07.000 --> 13:07.940]  Hello.
[13:08.100 --> 13:08.800]  Hello.
[13:12.640 --> 13:13.200]  Hello.
[13:25.740 --> 13:38.480]  But if no one sees us, no one can see us.
[13:38.480 --> 13:39.620]  Let's see.
[13:42.120 --> 13:43.180]  You know what that whole group is?
[13:43.180 --> 13:43.180]  Why?
[13:43.180 --> 13:43.180]  That concrete park is not that concrete.
[13:43.200 --> 13:44.960]  I can't cope with the stupid big day!
[13:45.280 --> 13:45.720]  Understand?
[13:46.300 --> 13:46.680]  You're great.
[13:47.180 --> 13:47.620]  Patrick?
[13:48.840 --> 13:50.100]  Hi, Patrick.
[13:50.420 --> 13:51.480]  I thought that was you.
[13:51.620 --> 13:51.860]  Hello.
[13:52.200 --> 13:53.020]  This is...
[13:53.020 --> 13:55.300]  I think it isn't a ridiculous coming all the way up here,
[13:55.460 --> 13:56.560]  but they really are the best.
[13:56.800 --> 13:58.700]  Then why can't they get these things out?
[13:58.860 --> 14:00.440]  I mean, can you talk to these people
[14:00.440 --> 14:02.340]  or something I'm not getting anywhere?
[14:02.540 --> 14:03.420]  What are those?
[14:04.620 --> 14:05.200]  Oh, well, it's...
[14:05.760 --> 14:06.460]  Grandbury juice.
[14:06.680 --> 14:07.120]  Cranalfa.
[14:07.360 --> 14:07.720]  Really?
[14:08.260 --> 14:10.120]  Listen, if you could talk to them,
[14:10.220 --> 14:11.360]  I would really appreciate it.
[14:11.380 --> 14:12.000]  I'm really late.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.240]  I have a lunch appointment at Hugh Bear's in 15 minutes.
[14:14.260 --> 14:15.980]  Hugh Bear's that moved up town, right?
[14:16.260 --> 14:17.120]  Well, oh boy, listen.
[14:17.360 --> 14:18.880]  I've got to go thank you, Victoria.
[14:19.180 --> 14:20.940]  Maybe we could do lunch one day next week.
[14:21.100 --> 14:22.700]  You know, I'm downtown Wall Street quite often.
[14:22.740 --> 14:23.540]  I don't know. I'm a work-hole at the time.
[14:23.540 --> 14:24.400]  Well, what about a Saturday?
[14:26.100 --> 14:26.680]  Next Saturday?
[14:27.100 --> 14:27.360]  Sure.
[14:27.880 --> 14:28.620]  Can't. I'm afraid.
[14:28.740 --> 14:29.500]  I'm not gonna have lame days.
[14:29.580 --> 14:30.760]  Listen, I've really got to go.
[14:30.820 --> 14:31.440]  I'll... Christ.
[14:31.700 --> 14:32.200]  I'll call you.
[14:32.360 --> 14:32.700]  Okay.
[14:33.520 --> 14:33.860]  Two.
[14:34.840 --> 14:36.020]  Listen, you're dating Lewis.
[14:36.260 --> 14:36.680]  He's an Arizona.
[14:36.860 --> 14:38.960]  You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans.
[14:38.960 --> 14:40.680]  Where could you possibly be up to tonight?
[14:40.680 --> 14:42.440]  Stop it. I'm...
[14:42.440 --> 14:43.120]  A lot of lithium.
[14:43.760 --> 14:45.400]  Waiting for Lewis to call me.
[14:45.580 --> 14:46.880]  He said he called tonight.
[14:47.540 --> 14:47.940]  Pumpkin?
[14:49.180 --> 14:50.660]  Pumpkin, you're dating an asshole.
[14:51.160 --> 14:51.520]  Mm-hmm.
[14:51.740 --> 14:54.480]  Pumpkin, you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
[14:55.060 --> 14:58.540]  Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
[14:58.920 --> 15:01.720]  Patrick, stop calling me Pumpkin, okay?
[15:02.700 --> 15:03.580]  Let's go.
[15:04.340 --> 15:04.800]  Courtney?
[15:05.600 --> 15:06.200]  Dinner?
[15:06.660 --> 15:07.960]  I can't.
[15:08.100 --> 15:08.940]  I'm thinking towards you.
[15:12.040 --> 15:13.180]  Dors is nice.
[15:13.560 --> 15:14.620]  Or something fabulous.
[15:29.200 --> 15:29.880]  Dors, yeah.
[15:30.420 --> 15:36.360]  Yes, I know it's a little late, but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight thirty, perhaps?
[15:42.880 --> 15:44.400]  Oh, no.
[15:44.400 --> 15:44.420]  Oh, no.
[15:45.840 --> 15:46.560]  Oh, no.
[15:47.160 --> 15:48.680]  Oh, no.
[15:53.760 --> 15:57.500]  Fatial and Elizabeth Harden, which was really relaxing.
[15:59.060 --> 16:06.060]  And then to the pottery bar, where I got this little silver muffin dish.
[16:06.660 --> 16:07.600]  That don't look trumps, girl.
[16:07.880 --> 16:09.380]  God, Patrick, shut up.
[16:09.380 --> 16:15.300]  You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium or have a diet coke, some caffeine, I get you out of this slime.
[16:15.360 --> 16:17.080]  I just want a child.
[16:18.420 --> 16:19.440]  Just two.
[16:20.920 --> 16:21.440]  Perfect.
[16:23.720 --> 16:24.240]  Children.
[16:29.600 --> 16:31.100]  Are we here?
[16:31.620 --> 16:31.880]  Yeah.
[16:39.960 --> 16:41.580]  This is Dorsia?
[16:41.900 --> 16:42.720]  Yes, dear.
[16:44.380 --> 16:48.560]  Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash.
[16:49.300 --> 16:52.720]  New York matinee called it a playful, but mysterious little dish.
[16:53.260 --> 16:53.780]  You'll love it.
[16:54.540 --> 16:57.000]  And then the red snapper with violets and pine nuts.
[16:57.760 --> 16:58.820]  I think that'll fall nicely.
[16:59.660 --> 17:00.100]  Hmm.
[17:01.740 --> 17:02.900]  Thanks, Patrick.
[17:09.500 --> 17:11.380]  Thanks so much for looking after Courtney.
[17:12.440 --> 17:14.100]  Dorsia, how impressive.
[17:14.920 --> 17:16.500]  How on earth did you get a reservation there?
[17:17.240 --> 17:17.880]  Lucky, I guess.
[17:19.800 --> 17:21.500]  That's a wonderful suit.
[17:21.980 --> 17:22.300]  Don't tell me.
[17:22.360 --> 17:22.720]  Don't tell me.
[17:22.760 --> 17:23.140]  Let me guess.
[17:25.800 --> 17:26.760]  Valentino Couture.
[17:27.180 --> 17:27.440]  Oh, huh.
[17:29.120 --> 17:30.080]  Looks so soft.
[17:30.780 --> 17:32.580]  Your compliment was sufficient, Lewis.
[17:34.160 --> 17:35.600]  Hello, Albert Stramm.
[17:36.180 --> 17:36.740]  Nice tie.
[17:36.740 --> 17:38.880]  How the hell are you?
[17:39.240 --> 17:42.140]  Alan has mistaken me for this dig head Marcus Halverstramm.
[17:42.520 --> 17:47.260]  It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P, and in fact does the same exact thing I do.
[17:47.760 --> 17:51.500]  He also has a pension for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples' glasses.
[17:52.080 --> 17:53.500]  Marcus and I even go to the same barber.
[17:53.880 --> 17:55.440]  Although I have a slightly better haircut.
[17:55.920 --> 17:57.660]  So how's the Branson account, Corn Marcus?
[17:58.040 --> 17:59.280]  It's, uh, it's all right.
[17:59.360 --> 18:00.340]  Really? That's interesting.
[18:00.500 --> 18:02.100]  It's not great.
[18:02.340 --> 18:02.900]  Oh, well, you know.
[18:03.240 --> 18:04.180]  So how Cecilia?
[18:04.960 --> 18:05.920]  She's a great girl.
[18:05.920 --> 18:06.540]  Oh, yeah.
[18:06.900 --> 18:07.680]  I'm very lucky.
[18:08.080 --> 18:08.960]  Hey, Alan.
[18:09.500 --> 18:10.900]  Congratulations on the Fisher account.
[18:11.160 --> 18:11.980]  Thank you, Baxter.
[18:12.460 --> 18:14.180]  Listen, Paul, squash.
[18:18.000 --> 18:18.820]  Come here.
[18:20.740 --> 18:21.580]  What Friday?
[18:21.740 --> 18:22.480]  No can do.
[18:23.640 --> 18:25.640]  I got an 830 res at Dorcia.
[18:26.140 --> 18:28.660]  Great sea urchin ceviche.
[18:29.740 --> 18:31.140]  Dorcia and Friday night.
[18:31.260 --> 18:31.880]  I really swing that.
[18:32.460 --> 18:33.160]  I think he's lying.
[18:36.440 --> 18:37.300]  Is that a gram?
[18:38.660 --> 18:39.540]  New card.
[18:40.200 --> 18:41.140]  What do you think?
[18:42.960 --> 18:43.460]  Woo-hoo.
[18:44.180 --> 18:44.980]  Very nice.
[18:45.800 --> 18:46.720]  Look at that.
[18:47.220 --> 18:48.540]  Pick them up from the printers yesterday.
[18:49.260 --> 18:50.560]  Good car, and that's bone.
[18:51.560 --> 18:54.040]  And the lettering is something called Sillian Braille.
[18:54.340 --> 18:55.960]  It's a very cool baby, but that's nothing.
[18:56.680 --> 18:57.120]  Look at this.
[18:58.100 --> 18:59.660]  That is really nice.
[19:00.240 --> 19:02.040]  Egg shell with remollion type.
[19:03.240 --> 19:03.820]  What do you think?
[19:05.280 --> 19:05.960]  Nice.
[19:06.780 --> 19:07.460]  Jesus.
[19:08.000 --> 19:09.500]  That is really super.
[19:09.600 --> 19:11.000]  How don't it look like you get so tasteful?
[19:12.180 --> 19:16.420]  I can't believe that Bryce prefers Van Patten's card to mine.
[19:16.820 --> 19:17.100]  But wait.
[19:18.480 --> 19:19.640]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[19:21.660 --> 19:23.020]  Raised lettering.
[19:23.320 --> 19:24.200]  Pale Nimbus.
[19:25.400 --> 19:25.680]  White.
[19:27.500 --> 19:28.180]  Impressive.
[19:29.140 --> 19:29.600]  Very nice.
[19:30.100 --> 19:30.320]  Hmm.
[19:32.560 --> 19:33.980]  Let's see Paul Allen's card.
[19:48.500 --> 19:50.180]  Look at that subtle, off-white coloring.
[19:51.560 --> 19:53.020]  A tasteful thickness of it.
[19:53.740 --> 19:54.320]  Oh my God.
[19:55.240 --> 19:56.400]  It even has a watermark.
[20:00.780 --> 20:02.240]  Something wrong?
[20:03.000 --> 20:03.460]  Patrick?
[20:04.100 --> 20:05.020]  You're sweating.
[20:34.300 --> 20:34.820]  Hello.
[20:36.120 --> 20:36.960]  Pat David.
[20:37.740 --> 20:39.360]  You want some money?
[20:40.180 --> 20:40.900]  So food?
[20:43.480 --> 20:44.920]  Is this what you need?
[20:45.740 --> 20:46.260]  Hungry.
[20:46.560 --> 20:46.760]  Yeah.
[20:47.200 --> 20:48.140]  Cold out, too, isn't it?
[20:52.880 --> 20:54.120]  Why don't you get a job?
[20:54.620 --> 20:55.360]  You're so hungry.
[20:55.480 --> 20:56.280]  Why don't you get a job?
[20:56.380 --> 20:56.380]  I'm hungry.
[20:56.380 --> 20:56.380]  I'm hungry.
[20:56.380 --> 20:57.700]  I lost my job.
[20:58.860 --> 20:59.140]  Why?
[20:59.880 --> 21:00.660]  You're drinking.
[21:01.420 --> 21:02.480]  Is that why you lost it?
[21:03.580 --> 21:04.520]  Insider trading?
[21:05.640 --> 21:06.480]  Just joking.
[21:07.000 --> 21:07.260]  Listen.
[21:07.720 --> 21:08.340]  What's your name?
[21:09.260 --> 21:09.440]  Al.
[21:10.080 --> 21:10.200]  Hmm?
[21:10.400 --> 21:10.660]  Speak up.
[21:10.780 --> 21:11.340]  Al.
[21:12.240 --> 21:13.440]  Get a goddamn job.
[21:14.020 --> 21:14.240]  Al.
[21:14.600 --> 21:15.700]  You got a negative attitude.
[21:16.440 --> 21:17.560]  That's what's stopping you.
[21:17.880 --> 21:19.080]  You got to get your act together.
[21:19.600 --> 21:20.460]  I'll help you.
[21:21.140 --> 21:23.300]  You are so kind, Mr.
[21:23.540 --> 21:25.440]  You're kind, you're kind, man.
[21:25.440 --> 21:26.040]  It's okay.
[21:26.040 --> 21:26.080]  I don't care.
[21:26.620 --> 21:27.000]  Please.
[21:27.540 --> 21:28.900]  You got to tell me what to do.
[21:29.340 --> 21:30.380]  You're kind of helping me.
[21:30.420 --> 21:31.040]  I'm so cold.
[21:31.700 --> 21:32.460]  I'm hungry.
[21:34.740 --> 21:36.140]  You know bad you smell.
[21:36.640 --> 21:37.560]  You're weak of shit.
[21:38.140 --> 21:38.620]  Do you know that?
[21:39.200 --> 21:39.400]  Ow.
[21:40.200 --> 21:40.740]  Ow.
[21:42.440 --> 21:43.260]  I'm sorry.
[21:45.100 --> 21:46.180]  Just a...
[21:46.180 --> 21:46.800]  I don't know.
[21:49.440 --> 21:50.680]  I don't have anything in common with you.
[22:00.000 --> 22:01.420]  Oh, thank you, Mr.
[22:01.640 --> 22:02.620]  Thank you.
[22:02.620 --> 22:03.220]  You're welcome.
[22:04.080 --> 22:04.880]  I'm a cold guy.
[22:05.360 --> 22:06.980]  It's not a fucking loser you are.
[22:07.160 --> 22:07.240]  What?
[22:07.480 --> 22:07.580]  Hmm?
[22:08.080 --> 22:08.540]  What?
[22:10.280 --> 22:10.760]  What?
[22:12.000 --> 22:12.480]  What?
[22:12.760 --> 22:12.880]  What?
[22:13.240 --> 22:13.240]  What?
[22:13.240 --> 22:13.240]  What?
[22:13.240 --> 22:13.520]  What?
[22:13.520 --> 22:13.900]  What?
[22:14.500 --> 22:14.980]  What?
[22:15.500 --> 22:15.980]  What?
[22:16.100 --> 22:16.100]  What?
[22:16.440 --> 22:16.920]  What?
[22:17.200 --> 22:17.680]  What?
[22:17.760 --> 22:17.840]  What?
[22:17.840 --> 22:17.840]  What?
[22:17.840 --> 22:17.840]  What?
[22:17.840 --> 22:17.840]  What?
[22:18.480 --> 22:18.960]  What?
[22:19.000 --> 22:19.000]  What?
[22:21.680 --> 22:22.160]  What?
[22:32.620 --> 22:33.180]  What?
[22:33.460 --> 22:33.460]  What?
[22:33.460 --> 22:33.460]  What?
[22:33.560 --> 22:33.560]  What?
[22:33.560 --> 22:33.560]  What?
[22:33.560 --> 22:33.560]  What?
[22:33.560 --> 22:33.560]  What?
[22:33.560 --> 22:33.560]  What?
[22:33.560 --> 22:33.560]  What?
[22:33.560 --> 22:33.560]  What?
[22:33.560 --> 22:34.780]  What beautiful skin you have Mr. Bacon.
[22:36.380 --> 22:36.940]  So fine.
[22:37.880 --> 22:38.420]  So smooth.
[22:40.900 --> 22:41.460]  So smooth.
[22:43.300 --> 22:43.860]  So smooth.
[22:43.860 --> 22:43.860]  So smooth.
[22:43.860 --> 22:43.860]  So smooth.
[22:43.860 --> 22:48.980]  I have all the characteristics of a human being.
[22:48.980 --> 22:52.020]  Flesh, blood, skin, hair.
[22:52.720 --> 22:55.700]  But not a single clear identifiable emotion,
[22:56.200 --> 22:58.580]  except for greed and disgust.
[23:00.160 --> 23:02.300]  Something horrible is happening inside of me,
[23:02.900 --> 23:04.260]  and I don't know why.
[23:05.640 --> 23:08.600]  My nightly blood lust has overflowed into my days.
[23:09.420 --> 23:12.520]  I feel lethal on the verge of frenzy.
[23:13.320 --> 23:15.880]  I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.
[23:17.880 --> 23:19.780]  Thanks for all the fun, sir.
[23:19.940 --> 23:22.320]  I'm asking for the love of the love.
[23:22.320 --> 23:24.820]  The love takes decisions to be Chinese.
[23:25.120 --> 23:26.980]  The love of the love of the love of the love of the love.
[23:28.700 --> 23:29.940]  Hey, look, boy.
[23:30.420 --> 23:31.040]  What do you say?
[23:32.080 --> 23:34.080]  Hey Hamilton, have a holly jolly Christmas.
[23:34.420 --> 23:36.240]  Is Alan still handling the Fisher account?
[23:36.680 --> 23:37.940]  Of course, who else?
[23:38.660 --> 23:41.120]  Nissel Taylor, my ex-nist Patrick.
[23:41.500 --> 23:42.860]  My ex-nist Harry.
[23:42.860 --> 23:44.580]  Harry, Harry, first of all.
[23:44.740 --> 23:45.200]  You lay, honey.
[23:46.000 --> 23:46.980]  Oh, as you are.
[23:47.360 --> 23:48.760]  I've been here the entire time.
[23:48.920 --> 23:49.780]  You just didn't see me.
[23:50.120 --> 23:51.140]  Say hello to Snowball.
[23:51.600 --> 23:53.900]  Snowball says, new, Christmas Patrick.
[23:54.680 --> 23:55.260]  What is it?
[23:55.740 --> 23:56.780]  It's a little baby baby.
[23:56.780 --> 23:57.900]  We can hear him, isn't it?
[23:58.400 --> 23:59.880]  It's a Vietnamese patty-like pig.
[24:00.300 --> 24:01.140]  Like darling pets.
[24:02.000 --> 24:02.400]  Don't you?
[24:03.200 --> 24:03.740]  Don't you?
[24:05.300 --> 24:06.600]  Stop scaring Patrick.
[24:06.600 --> 24:07.620]  You're such a grinch.
[24:08.220 --> 24:09.660]  What does Mr. Grinch want for Christmas?
[24:10.440 --> 24:11.760]  And don't say breast implants again.
[24:15.200 --> 24:15.720]  Alan.
[24:16.240 --> 24:16.560]  Marcus.
[24:17.300 --> 24:18.960]  Mary Christmas, how you been?
[24:19.200 --> 24:20.260]  Work all like I suppose?
[24:20.780 --> 24:21.640]  I haven't seen you in a while.
[24:22.700 --> 24:25.600]  Hey Hamilton, we're going to Nell's limo's out front.
[24:26.620 --> 24:27.500]  We should have dinner.
[24:27.940 --> 24:29.760]  Maybe you could bring Cecilia?
[24:31.040 --> 24:32.080]  Yes, Cecilia.
[24:32.400 --> 24:34.520]  Oh Cecilia would adore it.
[24:34.840 --> 24:36.120]  Well then, let's do it Marcus.
[24:36.880 --> 24:37.700]  Great party.
[24:38.100 --> 24:38.520]  Thanks.
[24:39.260 --> 24:40.460]  Patrick, why is he going to Marcus?
[24:40.460 --> 24:40.600]  I guess.
[24:42.500 --> 24:43.560]  Missed to alert.
[24:52.420 --> 24:54.480]  Marcus Heller Strang for two at seven.
[24:56.980 --> 24:57.960]  No, I want to know.
[24:58.440 --> 25:00.600]  I came here for the cilantro croffish gumbo.
[25:01.080 --> 25:04.420]  All right, which is after all the only excuse one time for being in this restaurant,
[25:04.540 --> 25:06.740]  which is, by the way, almost completely empty?
[25:07.120 --> 25:08.000]  I'm very sorry, sir.
[25:08.000 --> 25:09.900]  J.M.B. Straight and a corona.
[25:10.360 --> 25:12.500]  Would you like to hear the double absolute martini?
[25:13.320 --> 25:13.860]  Yes, sir.
[25:14.580 --> 25:15.780]  Would you like to hear the specials?
[25:15.880 --> 25:17.160]  Not if you want to keep your spleen.
[25:21.080 --> 25:23.320]  This is a real B-hive of activity.
[25:23.400 --> 25:24.960]  Howver strand this place is hot.
[25:25.520 --> 25:26.160]  Very hot.
[25:26.380 --> 25:30.440]  Listen, the mud soup and charcoal irregular are outrageous here.
[25:30.560 --> 25:31.820]  Yeah, well, you're late.
[25:32.100 --> 25:33.520]  Hey, I'm a child of divorce.
[25:33.780 --> 25:34.240]  Give me a break.
[25:34.240 --> 25:38.680]  I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime gel.
[25:38.880 --> 25:40.000]  We should have gone to Dorcia.
[25:40.600 --> 25:42.020]  I could have gotten this a table.
[25:42.560 --> 25:43.360]  Nobody goes there anymore.
[25:45.680 --> 25:47.360]  Is that Ivana Trump?
[25:49.300 --> 25:50.240]  Geez, Patrick.
[25:50.580 --> 25:52.340]  I mean, Marcus, what are you thinking?
[25:53.080 --> 25:55.240]  Why would Ivana be a Texarkana?
[25:56.540 --> 26:00.280]  So, uh, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account?
[26:00.820 --> 26:01.700]  How'd you get it?
[26:01.700 --> 26:03.960]  Well, I could tell you that helper strand.
[26:05.340 --> 26:06.660]  But they don't have to kill you.
[26:14.640 --> 26:16.160]  I like to die-set girls.
[26:16.900 --> 26:17.980]  Did you know I'm utterly insane?
[26:18.500 --> 26:22.140]  Uh, uh, uh, great tan, Marcus.
[26:22.400 --> 26:23.640]  I mean, really impressive.
[26:23.920 --> 26:24.400]  Where'd he tan?
[26:24.840 --> 26:25.220]  It's a lawn.
[26:25.740 --> 26:26.820]  I've got a tanning bed at home.
[26:27.180 --> 26:27.980]  You should look into it.
[26:28.980 --> 26:30.840]  And, uh, Cecilia.
[26:31.460 --> 26:32.120]  How is she?
[26:32.620 --> 26:33.480]  Where is she tonight?
[26:34.220 --> 26:36.200]  Cecilia's, uh, well, you know, Cecilia.
[26:36.380 --> 26:39.460]  I think she's having dinner with, um, Evelyn Williams.
[26:40.080 --> 26:40.440]  Evelyn.
[26:41.800 --> 26:42.580]  Great ass.
[26:42.900 --> 26:45.460]  Goes out with that loser, Patrick, babe, and what a dork.
[26:47.360 --> 26:48.640]  Another Martini, Paul.
[26:54.980 --> 26:56.520]  You like Huey Lewis in the news?
[26:58.000 --> 26:58.840]  They're okay.
[27:00.760 --> 27:04.740]  Their early work was a little too... new wave for my taste.
[27:05.580 --> 27:09.340]  But when sports came out in 83, I think they really came into their own.
[27:09.920 --> 27:11.000]  Commercial in artistically.
[27:14.140 --> 27:19.640]  The whole album has a clear crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism
[27:19.640 --> 27:22.240]  that really gives the songs a big boost.
[27:32.440 --> 27:34.540]  He's been compared to Elvis Costello.
[27:34.840 --> 27:38.260]  But I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.
[27:39.580 --> 27:40.480]  Hey, Albert, you're straight.
[27:40.720 --> 27:41.240]  Yes, Alan?
[27:41.820 --> 27:44.720]  Why are the copies of the style section on the play, do you?
[27:45.420 --> 27:48.560]  If a dog, a little chow or something.
[27:49.600 --> 27:50.380]  No, Alan.
[27:50.740 --> 27:52.040]  Is that a raincoat?
[27:52.440 --> 27:53.080]  Yes, it is.
[27:54.940 --> 27:55.780]  It's 87.
[27:55.780 --> 27:57.260]  I love him. Huey released this.
[27:57.820 --> 27:59.480]  Four. They're most accomplished album.
[27:59.820 --> 28:02.760]  I think they're undisputed masterpiece, hip to be swear.
[28:03.220 --> 28:04.120]  Songs so catchy.
[28:04.480 --> 28:06.300]  Most people probably don't listen to the lyrics.
[28:06.760 --> 28:07.320]  But they should.
[28:07.660 --> 28:11.240]  Because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends.
[28:11.580 --> 28:14.420]  It's also a personal statement about the band itself.
[28:15.220 --> 28:15.840]  Hey, Paul.
[28:16.900 --> 28:17.140]  Ah!
[28:17.900 --> 28:19.660]  Can you take, burn a spell?
[28:21.140 --> 28:21.980]  I'm the star.
[28:21.980 --> 28:24.420]  I can't even wait to make the door get down.
[28:24.660 --> 28:25.500]  You fuck me.
[28:25.740 --> 28:26.780]  Don't take back that.
[28:27.640 --> 28:28.620]  You can just hide it.
[28:29.800 --> 28:31.220]  You fuck me.
[28:31.640 --> 28:32.800]  I'm the star.
[28:32.840 --> 28:33.920]  I don't even care.
[28:34.200 --> 28:34.740]  I'm the star.
[28:34.980 --> 28:36.200]  It's still what's going on.
[28:36.920 --> 28:38.180]  It's hip to be swear.
[28:40.020 --> 28:41.540]  It's hip to be swear.
[28:44.360 --> 28:46.800]  I'm back my fans in Minnesota.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.620]  I want you to move to the heat.
[28:51.500 --> 28:54.320]  I'm looking out for every day.
[28:54.660 --> 28:56.580]  And why I'm doing what I eat.
[28:58.360 --> 29:00.640]  It can be that it's good for me.
[29:01.540 --> 29:03.820]  But I don't even care.
[29:04.740 --> 29:06.240]  I'm done with crazy.
[29:07.000 --> 29:08.020]  I know that's nowhere.
[29:08.720 --> 29:10.500]  There is no denying that.
[29:11.000 --> 29:12.280]  It's hip to be swear.
[29:14.000 --> 29:15.740]  It's hip to be swear.
[29:15.740 --> 29:15.740]  It's hip to be swear.
[29:15.740 --> 29:15.940]  It's hip to be swear.
[29:15.940 --> 29:18.460]  It's hip to be swear.
[29:18.460 --> 29:23.060]  It's hip to be swear.
[29:23.060 --> 29:27.940]  It's hip to be swear.
[29:28.840 --> 29:37.340]  It's hip to be swear.
[29:37.460 --> 29:38.000]  Patrick?
[29:38.800 --> 29:39.020]  Patrick!
[29:39.620 --> 29:39.620]  Patrick!
[29:40.280 --> 29:41.500]  Is that you?
[29:41.820 --> 29:42.300]  No, Lewis.
[29:42.820 --> 29:43.460]  It's not me.
[29:43.980 --> 29:44.600]  You're mistaken.
[29:44.600 --> 29:47.180]  This is my very good friend, Patrick Payton.
[29:47.720 --> 29:48.560]  Where are you going?
[29:49.060 --> 29:49.840]  We're going to Nell.
[29:50.340 --> 29:51.580]  Gwendolyn's father is buying it.
[29:52.160 --> 29:52.700]  Oh.
[29:55.680 --> 29:57.580]  Where did you get that overnight bag?
[30:00.260 --> 30:01.120]  Champalgo, yeah.
[30:01.120 --> 30:01.160]  I'm sorry.
[30:13.440 --> 30:15.240]  When I get to Paul Allen's place,
[30:15.540 --> 30:18.720]  I use the keys I took from his pocket before disposing of the body.
[30:19.400 --> 30:21.860]  There is a moment of sheer panic.
[30:22.600 --> 30:25.660]  When I realize that Paul's apartment overlooks the park,
[30:26.800 --> 30:29.040]  and it's obviously more expensive than mine.
[30:32.800 --> 30:35.880]  I calm myself and move into the bedroom,
[30:36.160 --> 30:38.500]  where I find his suitcase and start the pack.
[30:39.480 --> 30:41.520]  It's time for Paul to take a little trip.
[30:44.820 --> 30:45.940]  Where's the bastard?
[30:47.140 --> 30:47.620]  Dallas.
[30:48.940 --> 30:49.480]  Paris.
[30:50.340 --> 30:51.080]  Is it a portal?
[30:52.000 --> 30:52.620]  What the fuck?
[31:02.340 --> 31:03.380]  Hi, this is Paul.
[31:03.900 --> 31:05.440]  I've been called away to London for a few days.
[31:05.820 --> 31:07.320]  Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.
[31:07.960 --> 31:09.160]  I still a little beast of baby.
[31:19.100 --> 31:21.220]  Lady of man.
[31:24.580 --> 31:27.280]  Is dancing with me.
[31:29.640 --> 31:30.640]  Chanted, chanted.
[31:30.780 --> 31:32.880]  There's nobody here.
[31:34.460 --> 31:35.060]  What is it?
[31:36.660 --> 31:37.160]  Patrick.
[31:38.540 --> 31:39.340]  Yes, Jean.
[31:40.400 --> 31:42.460]  There's Mr. Donald Campbell here to see you.
[31:44.020 --> 31:45.140]  Detective Donald Campbell.
[31:50.220 --> 31:51.280]  Tell him I'm at lunch.
[31:52.560 --> 31:54.400]  Patrick, it's only 10.30.
[31:54.520 --> 31:55.340]  I think he knows you're here.
[31:56.640 --> 31:57.820]  Send him in, I guess.
[32:04.920 --> 32:07.180]  Now, Jean, you've got to wear clothes
[32:07.180 --> 32:08.460]  and purport since your physique.
[32:09.260 --> 32:11.060]  There are definite do's and don'ts good buddy
[32:11.060 --> 32:12.340]  of wearing a bold striped shirt.
[32:12.520 --> 32:15.560]  A bold striped shirt calls for solid colored
[32:15.560 --> 32:17.900]  or the sweetly patterned suits and ties.
[32:18.420 --> 32:21.440]  Yes, always tip the stylus 15%.
[32:21.440 --> 32:23.360]  Listen, Jean, I've got to go.
[32:23.520 --> 32:24.960]  T-Boom pickens just walked in.
[32:25.580 --> 32:26.320]  Just joking.
[32:27.420 --> 32:28.760]  No, don't hit the owner of the salon.
[32:30.040 --> 32:31.220]  Okay, Jean, right?
[32:32.280 --> 32:32.720]  Got it.
[32:34.340 --> 32:34.820]  Sorry.
[32:35.500 --> 32:37.700]  No, I'm sorry, I should have made an appointment.
[32:38.280 --> 32:40.100]  Was that anything important?
[32:40.460 --> 32:40.700]  All that?
[32:41.320 --> 32:42.900]  Just mulling over business problems,
[32:43.200 --> 32:45.440]  examining opportunities, exchanging rumors,
[32:46.500 --> 32:47.260]  spreading gossip.
[32:49.740 --> 32:51.520]  Hi, I'm Donald Kimball.
[32:52.500 --> 32:54.660]  Hi, Pat Bateman, nice to meet you.
[32:54.940 --> 32:56.260]  I'm sorry to barge in on you like this.
[32:56.580 --> 32:58.220]  I know how busy you guys can get.
[33:00.780 --> 33:05.340]  So, what's the, uh, topic of discussion?
[33:05.640 --> 33:07.300]  I've been hired by Meredith Powell
[33:07.980 --> 33:11.020]  to investigate the disappearance of Paul Allen.
[33:12.380 --> 33:15.220]  I see, uh, Paul's disappearance, yeah.
[33:15.220 --> 33:17.000]  So, it's nothing that official.
[33:17.340 --> 33:20.080]  I just have some basic questions about Paul Allen about yourself.
[33:20.360 --> 33:20.540]  Coffee?
[33:20.900 --> 33:21.740]  No, I'm okay.
[33:22.180 --> 33:22.740]  Paul and Ars?
[33:23.080 --> 33:23.880]  No, I'm okay.
[33:25.720 --> 33:27.940]  Can you bring Mr. Kimball?
[33:28.240 --> 33:30.160]  Mr. Kimball, a bottle of a polyamà
[33:30.160 --> 33:30.540]  No, I'm okay.
[33:30.620 --> 33:31.140]  It's no problem.
[33:34.420 --> 33:36.220]  So, what's the topic of discussion?
[33:38.280 --> 33:39.780]  Disappearance of Paul Allen.
[33:40.040 --> 33:40.460]  Right.
[33:41.200 --> 33:42.140]  Well, Ià
[33:44.640 --> 33:48.760]  I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything,
[33:48.920 --> 33:50.740]  not on page six at least.
[33:51.100 --> 33:52.840]  I think his family wants to escape quiet.
[33:53.260 --> 33:53.760]  Understandable.
[33:54.100 --> 33:54.480]  Lime?
[33:54.800 --> 33:55.700]  No, really.
[33:55.920 --> 33:56.300]  I'm okay.
[33:56.540 --> 33:57.820]  Sure, I can always get you alive.
[33:58.040 --> 34:01.180]  Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files.
[34:01.420 --> 34:02.000]  Okay, shoot.
[34:03.440 --> 34:04.140]  How old are you?
[34:04.720 --> 34:05.140]  27.
[34:06.460 --> 34:07.560]  Where did you go to school?
[34:07.920 --> 34:08.200]  Harvard.
[34:08.600 --> 34:09.820]  Then Harvard Business School.
[34:10.200 --> 34:10.620]  Your address?
[34:11.120 --> 34:13.320]  American Gardens Building, West 81st Street.
[34:13.760 --> 34:14.200]  Nice.
[34:14.560 --> 34:15.060]  Very nice.
[34:15.700 --> 34:15.980]  Thanks.
[34:17.140 --> 34:18.740]  What can you tell me about Paul Allen?
[34:19.140 --> 34:19.840]  I'm on a loss.
[34:20.880 --> 34:22.480]  He was part of that whole Yale thing.
[34:22.700 --> 34:23.300]  Yale thing.
[34:23.660 --> 34:24.560]  Yeah, Yale thing.
[34:25.160 --> 34:26.240]  What do you mean, Yale thing?
[34:26.680 --> 34:30.240]  Well, I think from one that he was probably a closet homosexual
[34:30.240 --> 34:33.580]  who did a lot of cocaine at Yale thing.
[34:34.960 --> 34:36.420]  What kind of man was he?
[34:37.040 --> 34:38.900]  That besides the information you've just given?
[34:38.900 --> 34:40.720]  Hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
[34:41.000 --> 34:41.760]  You feel like that?
[34:42.820 --> 34:43.660]  No, not really.
[34:45.720 --> 34:46.880]  Where did Paul hang out?
[34:47.840 --> 34:48.320]  Hang out?
[34:48.680 --> 34:49.700]  Yeah, you know, hang out.
[34:50.120 --> 34:50.800]  Let me think.
[34:51.480 --> 34:52.360]  The Newport.
[34:53.560 --> 34:54.000]  Harry's.
[34:54.560 --> 34:55.000]  Fluteys.
[34:55.980 --> 34:56.860]  Indoshine Nells.
[34:57.220 --> 34:58.120]  The Cornell Club.
[34:58.340 --> 34:59.400]  The New York Yacht Club.
[34:59.600 --> 35:00.120]  Yeah, the Yacht?
[35:00.820 --> 35:01.860]  No, he just hung out there.
[35:02.260 --> 35:03.700]  And where did he go to school?
[35:06.060 --> 35:07.040]  Don't you know this?
[35:07.040 --> 35:08.860]  I just wanted to know if you know.
[35:13.280 --> 35:16.420]  Before Yale, if I remember correctly, St. Paul's.
[35:16.500 --> 35:16.740]  Listen.
[35:17.920 --> 35:18.720]  I just...
[35:18.720 --> 35:19.820]  I just want to help.
[35:21.480 --> 35:22.160]  And I stand.
[35:25.440 --> 35:26.860]  Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
[35:27.240 --> 35:29.820]  Well, there's a message on his answering machine
[35:29.820 --> 35:31.260]  that says he went to London.
[35:31.660 --> 35:32.260]  Maybe he did, huh?
[35:32.620 --> 35:33.800]  His girlfriend doesn't think so.
[35:34.020 --> 35:35.020]  But has anyone seen him in London?
[35:35.020 --> 35:36.060]  Actually, yes.
[35:36.600 --> 35:36.880]  Hmm.
[35:37.360 --> 35:39.380]  But I've had a hard time getting actual verification.
[35:39.740 --> 35:43.140]  A Stephen Hughes said he saw him at a restaurant there.
[35:43.280 --> 35:44.000]  But I checked it out.
[35:44.080 --> 35:47.060]  And what happened is he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth for Paul so.
[35:47.780 --> 35:49.180]  Had his apartment been burglarized?
[35:49.480 --> 35:50.840]  No, actually it hadn't.
[35:51.640 --> 35:52.440]  Toiletries were missing.
[35:52.580 --> 35:53.440]  A suit was gone.
[35:53.600 --> 35:54.640]  So it was some luggage, that's it.
[35:54.940 --> 35:57.060]  I mean, no one's dealing with a homicide squad, yet, or anything, right?
[35:57.420 --> 35:57.980]  No, not yet.
[35:58.100 --> 35:59.060]  As I said, we're not sure.
[35:59.900 --> 36:01.760]  Basically, no one's seen or heard anything.
[36:02.520 --> 36:03.540]  So typical isn't it?
[36:03.540 --> 36:04.840]  It's just strange.
[36:05.500 --> 36:10.700]  One day someone's walking around going to work, alive, and then nothing.
[36:12.420 --> 36:13.820]  People just disappear.
[36:15.040 --> 36:18.220]  The earth just opens up and swallows them.
[36:19.740 --> 36:20.120]  Erie.
[36:20.940 --> 36:21.960]  Really, Erie.
[36:28.640 --> 36:30.700]  Listen, you'll have to excuse me.
[36:30.820 --> 36:32.860]  I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Hux to board.
[36:32.860 --> 36:34.520]  Four seasons in 20 minutes.
[36:35.240 --> 36:38.260]  The four seasons, isn't that a little far up town?
[36:38.640 --> 36:40.140]  I mean, aren't you going to be late?
[36:40.880 --> 36:41.860]  No, there's one down here.
[36:42.840 --> 36:43.400]  Oh, really?
[36:43.580 --> 36:44.000]  I think it's okay.
[36:44.280 --> 36:44.580]  Yes, it's very good.
[36:45.100 --> 36:49.040]  Listen, if anything else occurs to you, any information?
[36:49.220 --> 36:50.820]  Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
[36:51.140 --> 36:51.260]  Great.
[36:51.960 --> 36:55.420]  And thanks for your time, Mr. Bacon.
[36:59.360 --> 36:59.920]  Bye-bye.
[36:59.920 --> 37:00.920]  Bye-bye.
[37:57.060 --> 37:59.860]  Bye-bye.
[38:00.820 --> 38:02.260]  I haven't seen you around here.
[38:02.900 --> 38:04.220]  You just haven't been looking.
[38:04.700 --> 38:05.800]  I'd like to see my apartment.
[38:07.240 --> 38:08.680]  I'm not supposed to.
[38:10.720 --> 38:12.440]  You want to come to my apartment or not?
[38:14.680 --> 38:18.500]  I'm not supposed to, but I can make an exception.
[38:21.500 --> 38:22.760]  You think a credit card?
[38:24.320 --> 38:24.880]  I'm joking.
[38:25.660 --> 38:25.960]  Come on.
[38:26.380 --> 38:26.680]  Get in.
[38:36.760 --> 38:40.380]  I'd like a girl in early 20s blonde.
[38:41.300 --> 38:42.060]  Who does couples?
[38:42.940 --> 38:43.340]  Couples.
[38:43.940 --> 38:46.440]  Yeah, I really can't stress blonde enough.
[38:47.040 --> 38:47.580]  Blonde.
[38:50.680 --> 38:51.800]  I'm Paul.
[38:52.640 --> 38:54.100]  My name's Paul Allen.
[38:54.640 --> 38:55.080]  You got that.
[38:56.000 --> 38:57.300]  You're Christy.
[38:57.300 --> 38:59.760]  You're to respond only to Christy.
[39:00.340 --> 39:01.120]  Is that clear?
[39:11.880 --> 39:15.000]  It's a very fine shard in the air, drinkin'.
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.520]  I want you to clean your vagina.
[39:25.440 --> 39:25.940]  No.
[39:26.440 --> 39:27.280]  I'm behind you.
[39:27.280 --> 39:27.280]  I'm not.
[39:27.280 --> 39:27.280]  I'm not.
[39:27.280 --> 39:27.280]  I'm not.
[39:27.280 --> 39:27.280]  I'm not.
[39:27.280 --> 39:27.280]  I'm not.
[39:27.280 --> 39:27.280]  I'm not.
[39:27.280 --> 39:27.280]  I'm not.
[39:27.280 --> 39:27.280]  I'm not.
[39:27.280 --> 39:27.280]  I'm not.
[39:27.280 --> 39:27.280]  I'm not.
[39:27.280 --> 39:27.280]  I'm not.
[39:27.280 --> 39:27.280]  I'm not.
[39:27.280 --> 39:27.280]  I'm not.
[39:28.280 --> 39:28.820]  Get on your knees.
[39:30.280 --> 39:31.580]  You have a very nice bite.
[39:44.280 --> 39:45.640]  Thank you, Senator.
[39:49.720 --> 39:52.640]  Christy, get out and dry off.
[39:53.040 --> 39:53.740]  Choose a robe.
[39:54.520 --> 39:55.460]  Not the bejohn.
[39:56.020 --> 40:00.100]  And, uh, how am I meetin' me and our guest in the living room for drinks?
[40:07.220 --> 40:08.020]  You've arrived.
[40:08.540 --> 40:08.920]  How lovely.
[40:09.540 --> 40:10.400]  Let me take your code.
[40:11.380 --> 40:12.060]  I'm Paul.
[40:12.740 --> 40:13.480]  How good of you to come.
[40:18.980 --> 40:20.460]  I'm quite blonde, are you?
[40:21.420 --> 40:22.320]  More dirty blonde.
[40:23.480 --> 40:25.040]  I'm gonna call you Sabrina.
[40:26.400 --> 40:27.160]  I'm Paul Allen.
[40:48.740 --> 40:50.600]  So, don't you want to know what I do?
[40:54.920 --> 40:55.440]  No.
[40:56.240 --> 40:57.540]  No, not really.
[41:00.340 --> 41:02.180]  Well, I work on Wall Street.
[41:03.900 --> 41:04.620]  I'm Pearson Pierce.
[41:05.720 --> 41:06.380]  Have you heard of it?
[41:15.840 --> 41:18.520]  You have a really nice place here, Paul.
[41:20.040 --> 41:21.400]  How much did you pay for it?
[41:22.400 --> 41:25.580]  Well, actually, that's none of your business, Christy.
[41:26.260 --> 41:28.920]  But I can assure you, it certainly wasn't cheap.
[41:29.880 --> 41:30.180]  No.
[41:30.820 --> 41:31.940]  No smoking, not in here.
[41:34.740 --> 41:35.700]  Far to trouble.
[41:38.720 --> 41:43.860]  I don't want you to get drunk, but, uh, that's a very fine shard and a.
[41:44.200 --> 41:44.860]  You're not drinking.
[41:51.400 --> 41:53.940]  Do you like Phil Collins?
[41:55.040 --> 41:56.520]  Been a big Genesis fan.
[41:57.260 --> 42:00.520]  Ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke.
[42:01.680 --> 42:06.180]  Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work.
[42:07.040 --> 42:07.800]  It was too artsy.
[42:08.620 --> 42:09.300]  Doing the lecture.
[42:09.760 --> 42:15.120]  It was on Duke where, uh, Phil Collins' presence became more apparent.
[42:16.720 --> 42:22.480]  I think invisible touch is the group's on this beautiful masterpiece.
[42:25.020 --> 42:29.060]  It's an epic meditation on intangibility.
[42:31.660 --> 42:37.340]  At the same time, it deepens in enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums.
[42:39.160 --> 42:41.460]  Christy, take off the road.
[42:43.420 --> 42:47.960]  Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of banks, Collins, and Rutherford.
[42:49.280 --> 42:52.340]  You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument.
[42:53.640 --> 42:55.380]  Sabrina, remove your dress.
[42:56.540 --> 43:02.780]  In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, cheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism.
[43:03.920 --> 43:05.860]  Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little?
[43:07.340 --> 43:09.260]  Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion.
[43:10.260 --> 43:15.100]  In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority.
[43:17.320 --> 43:25.020]  Into deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about monogamy and commitment.
[43:26.180 --> 43:28.300]  The song is extremely uplifting.
[43:28.300 --> 43:35.620]  Your lyrics are as positive, affirmative, as, uh, anything I've heard in rock.
[43:39.980 --> 43:44.040]  Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole.
[43:45.560 --> 43:53.680]  Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way.
[43:54.300 --> 43:58.520]  Especially songs like In the Air tonight and, uh, I can't stop all on.
[44:00.860 --> 44:03.180]  Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it.
[44:04.720 --> 44:11.580]  I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group than as a solo artist.
[44:12.120 --> 44:14.520]  And I stress the word, artist.
[44:18.700 --> 44:20.320]  This is the studio.
[44:21.020 --> 44:22.220]  A great, great song.
[44:23.300 --> 44:24.400]  Personal favorite.
[44:35.340 --> 44:36.460]  Get the camera.
[45:14.520 --> 45:17.640]  Get the camera.
[45:31.960 --> 45:35.220]  I'm touched to watch.
[45:44.520 --> 45:44.520]  I'm touched to watch.
[45:58.520 --> 45:59.160]  Camera's on now.
[46:00.180 --> 46:01.480]  We're not through yet.
[46:20.060 --> 46:23.900]  If they have a good personality and they're not great looking, then who fucking cares?
[46:24.140 --> 46:26.940]  Just say hypothetically, okay, what if they have a good personality?
[46:29.760 --> 46:30.880]  I know, I know.
[46:31.360 --> 46:33.580]  There are no girls with good personalities.
[46:33.900 --> 46:36.740]  Good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body.
[46:37.240 --> 46:42.900]  We'll satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things and we'll essentially keep her thumb-fuckin mouth shut.
[46:42.900 --> 46:51.420]  The only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented though God knows what the fuck that means are ugly chicks.
[46:51.520 --> 46:51.920]  Absolutely.
[46:52.180 --> 46:55.480]  And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are.
[46:55.600 --> 46:56.960]  Do you know what Edgene said about women?
[46:57.320 --> 46:58.680]  Edgene, Matridae, can I borrow?
[46:58.840 --> 46:58.960]  No.
[46:59.440 --> 47:01.740]  Serial killer, Wisconsin in the 50s.
[47:01.860 --> 47:02.480]  And what did Ed say?
[47:02.560 --> 47:05.360]  He said, when I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things.
[47:05.860 --> 47:11.180]  One part of me wants to take her out and talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right.
[47:11.180 --> 47:12.440]  And what the other part of them think?
[47:13.160 --> 47:15.320]  What her head would look like on a stick.
[47:20.580 --> 47:21.240]  Hi guys.
[47:22.460 --> 47:24.060]  I want to get your opinion on something.
[47:25.280 --> 47:26.280]  It's my business card.
[47:27.720 --> 47:29.480]  I decide to get a new one too.
[47:33.340 --> 47:35.700]  Oh, it's very nice Louis.
[47:38.560 --> 47:39.140]  Thank you.
[47:45.080 --> 47:45.480]  I'm sorry.
[47:54.080 --> 47:55.160]  Listen, what about dinner?
[47:55.440 --> 47:57.560]  Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Padden?
[47:57.580 --> 47:58.540]  What about fucking dinner?
[47:59.180 --> 48:00.440]  Sheer up there, Bateman.
[48:00.440 --> 48:00.920]  What's the matter?
[48:01.040 --> 48:02.120]  No shiatsu this morning.
[48:02.300 --> 48:03.980]  Touching me like that and draw back a stop.
[48:04.200 --> 48:05.300]  I held on there a little buddy.
[48:05.660 --> 48:06.120]  Excuse me.
[48:39.760 --> 48:41.160]  I'm sorry.
[48:43.720 --> 48:47.740]  God, Patrick, why here?
[48:48.360 --> 48:49.460]  I've seen you looking at me.
[48:50.780 --> 48:54.780]  I've noticed your hot boy.
[48:56.440 --> 48:57.620]  Don't be shy.
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.380]  You can't imagine how long I've wanted this ever since that Christmas party.
[49:02.480 --> 49:03.400]  Arizona 206.
[49:03.780 --> 49:06.860]  You know the one you were wearing that red stripe paisley on Monty.ERROR:core.transcription:Transcription failed for H:\Movies\American Psycho (2000) x265-1080p.mkv: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u306a' in position 47: character maps to <undefined>

[49:10.480 --> 49:11.160]  I'm all right.
[49:12.280 --> 49:13.740]  I want you too.
[49:14.940 --> 49:16.340]  Patrick, what is it?
[49:17.840 --> 49:19.300]  Where are you going?
[49:20.440 --> 49:21.940]  I've got to return some video tapes.
[49:29.680 --> 49:30.280]  Patrick.
[49:52.240 --> 49:52.680]  I'm sorry.
[49:53.540 --> 49:53.900]  I'm sorry.
[49:54.680 --> 49:55.120]  I'm sorry.
[49:55.640 --> 49:55.640]  I'm sorry.
[49:56.100 --> 49:56.500]  I'm sorry.
[49:56.500 --> 49:57.080]  Okay, one day.
[49:57.700 --> 49:58.140]  Twenty.
[50:00.040 --> 50:00.860]  Any poem?
[50:03.360 --> 50:05.180]  Kimmel, I've been wanting to talk with you.
[50:05.300 --> 50:05.940]  Come in my office.
[50:06.340 --> 50:07.900]  Jean, great jacket, Matzuda.
[50:07.900 --> 50:11.620]  Do you remember where you were the night of Paul's disappearance,
[50:12.180 --> 50:14.140]  which was on 20th of December?
[50:14.880 --> 50:15.340]  God.
[50:16.500 --> 50:18.920]  I guess I was probably returning video tapes.
[50:22.620 --> 50:24.780]  I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
[50:25.260 --> 50:26.000]  That's not what I've got.
[50:26.880 --> 50:27.080]  What?
[50:27.660 --> 50:29.600]  That's not the information I've received.
[50:30.600 --> 50:31.380]  Well, I wait.
[50:32.080 --> 50:33.560]  What information have you received?
[50:33.560 --> 50:34.300]  Let me see.
[50:38.460 --> 50:39.320]  You were with...
[50:39.320 --> 50:40.400]  Well, I could be wrong.
[50:41.580 --> 50:43.480]  When was the last time you were with Paul Allen?
[50:43.980 --> 50:47.560]  We'd gone to a new musical called...
[50:48.340 --> 50:49.900]  Oh, Africa, Brave Africa.
[50:50.220 --> 50:51.080]  It was a Lafriot.
[50:51.620 --> 50:52.340]  I was about it.
[50:53.100 --> 50:54.580]  I think we had dinner at Orso.
[50:54.780 --> 50:56.120]  No, no, no, Orso.
[50:56.660 --> 50:58.820]  I hope I've been informative long day.
[50:59.300 --> 50:59.780]  It's got her.
[51:00.020 --> 51:01.080]  I know they'll spend not too.
[51:02.700 --> 51:05.100]  But how about lunch in a week or so
[51:05.520 --> 51:07.560]  when I've sorted out all this information?
[51:07.800 --> 51:08.000]  Great.
[51:08.200 --> 51:08.980]  Yes, I'd like that.
[51:09.120 --> 51:12.200]  And if you could try and pin down where you were
[51:12.660 --> 51:14.840]  the night of Paul Allen's disappearance,
[51:15.000 --> 51:16.340]  it would make my job a lot easier.
[51:16.540 --> 51:16.820]  Absolutely.
[51:17.280 --> 51:18.240]  I'm with you on that one.
[51:23.040 --> 51:24.300]  Here we lose in the news.
[51:27.020 --> 51:27.740]  Great stuff.
[51:28.340 --> 51:29.920]  I just bought it on my way here.
[51:29.920 --> 51:30.320]  Have you heard it?
[51:31.580 --> 51:31.980]  Never.
[51:33.280 --> 51:35.340]  I mean, I don't really like singers.
[51:35.700 --> 51:36.940]  Not a big music fan, huh?
[51:37.720 --> 51:38.680]  No, I like music.
[51:39.220 --> 51:40.920]  Just there...
[51:41.840 --> 51:43.580]  You used to play sound for me.
[51:44.460 --> 51:45.100]  Teach us something.
[51:47.740 --> 51:50.060]  So, lunch next week?
[51:50.740 --> 51:51.160]  I'll be there.
[52:02.780 --> 52:04.180]  Oh.
[52:04.860 --> 52:05.760]  Ah.
[52:06.740 --> 52:08.140]  Ah.
[52:08.140 --> 52:08.180]  Ah.
[52:10.260 --> 52:11.660]  Ah.
[52:11.660 --> 52:12.620]  Ah.
[52:13.380 --> 52:13.940]  Ah.
[52:21.160 --> 52:21.560]  Ah.
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.060]  Were you calling me before Easter?
[52:30.040 --> 52:30.760]  Maybe.
[52:35.460 --> 52:37.000]  What are you doing tonight?
[52:37.520 --> 52:39.520]  Dinner at a river cafe.
[52:40.300 --> 52:41.360]  Old bar afterwards, maybe.
[52:41.800 --> 52:42.240]  That's nice.
[52:44.600 --> 52:46.120]  I never knew you smoked.
[52:47.660 --> 52:48.920]  You never noticed.
[52:52.360 --> 52:55.260]  Listen, Patrick.
[52:56.300 --> 52:57.540]  Can we talk?
[53:03.160 --> 53:06.020]  You look marvelous.
[53:06.960 --> 53:08.660]  There's nothing to say.
[53:09.740 --> 53:10.740]  You're gonna marry Lewis.
[53:11.720 --> 53:12.800]  Isn't that special?
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.140]  Patrick.
[53:22.160 --> 53:22.580]  Yes, Courtney.
[53:26.160 --> 53:27.900]  If I don't see you before Easter,
[53:28.580 --> 53:30.320]  have a nice one, okay?
[53:36.160 --> 53:36.620]  You too.
[53:44.060 --> 53:45.100]  Patrick?
[53:46.420 --> 53:46.940]  Yeah?
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.040]  Nothing.
[54:04.960 --> 54:07.760]  The Villains lost first.

[04:32.060 --> 04:35.520]  Next subject, qualski me anion.
[04:36.020 --> 04:37.260]  Engineer, waste disposal.
[04:38.080 --> 04:41.200]  File section, new employee, six days.
[04:44.000 --> 04:44.240]  Come in.
[04:50.680 --> 04:52.600]  Replication section, never mind.
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.560]  We have a B1 security alert.
[04:54.980 --> 04:56.400]  Stand by for ID trust.
[04:57.880 --> 04:58.620]  Sit down.
[05:00.100 --> 05:01.420]  Replication section, never mind.
[05:04.200 --> 05:05.180]  Care if I talk?
[05:06.000 --> 05:07.840]  You're kind of nervous when I take tests.
[05:08.320 --> 05:09.300]  I just please don't move.
[05:09.300 --> 05:11.660]  Move, sorry.
[05:16.320 --> 05:18.020]  I already had a IQ test, I sure.
[05:18.580 --> 05:19.360]  I don't think I ever had a...
[05:19.360 --> 05:21.680]  Yeah, two times is a fact during this, so please pay attention.
[05:22.040 --> 05:23.260]  I answer as quickly as you can.
[05:24.800 --> 05:25.160]  Sure.
[05:27.980 --> 05:29.180]  1187 or something, too, I'm sorry.
[05:29.720 --> 05:30.260]  That's the hotel.
[05:30.520 --> 05:30.600]  What?
[05:31.180 --> 05:31.760]  Right, a live.
[05:32.840 --> 05:34.120]  Nice place to share a guess.
[05:34.780 --> 05:35.460]  Is that part of the test?
[05:36.420 --> 05:38.400]  No. Just warming up, that's all.
[05:39.820 --> 05:42.400]  It's not fancy or anything.
[05:43.620 --> 05:44.380]  You're in a desert.
[05:44.920 --> 05:46.540]  Walking along in the sand, when all of a sudden...
[05:46.540 --> 05:47.200]  Is the test now?
[05:47.400 --> 05:49.740]  Yes, you're in a desert walking along the sand.
[05:49.920 --> 05:51.080]  When all of a sudden you look warm.
[05:52.020 --> 05:52.260]  What?
[05:52.760 --> 05:53.280]  What desert?
[05:54.020 --> 05:56.580]  It doesn't make any difference what desert is completely hypothetical.
[05:57.120 --> 05:58.020]  But I'll come out, either.
[05:58.100 --> 05:58.740]  Maybe you're fed up.
[05:59.100 --> 06:00.240]  Maybe you want to be by yourself.
[06:00.460 --> 06:00.820]  Who knows?
[06:02.380 --> 06:04.260]  You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon.
[06:04.700 --> 06:05.440]  It's crawling towards you.
[06:05.440 --> 06:06.900]  You know what a tortoise will set?
[06:10.640 --> 06:11.800]  You know what a turtle is?
[06:12.260 --> 06:12.660]  Of course.
[06:13.380 --> 06:14.000]  Same thing.
[06:15.120 --> 06:16.080]  You've never seen a turtle.
[06:19.240 --> 06:20.360]  But I understand what you mean.
[06:21.240 --> 06:23.680]  You reach down and you flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
[06:24.240 --> 06:25.720]  Do you make up this question, Mr. Holden?
[06:26.520 --> 06:27.600]  Are they right? I'm down for you.
[06:29.100 --> 06:31.820]  A tortoise lays on his back, his belly baking in the hot sun,
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.420]  beating its legs, trying to turn itself over, but it can't.
[06:34.420 --> 06:36.480]  Not without your help, Leon.
[06:36.940 --> 06:37.940]  But you're not helping.
[06:38.060 --> 06:39.040]  What do you mean I'm not helping?
[06:39.480 --> 06:40.600]  I mean you're not helping.
[06:41.200 --> 06:42.200]  Why is that Leon?
[06:50.800 --> 06:52.140]  They're just questions, Leon.
[06:53.740 --> 06:56.160]  An answer to your query they're written down for me.
[06:56.960 --> 07:00.220]  It's a test designed to provoke an emotional response.
[07:03.520 --> 07:04.640]  Shall we continue?
[07:07.020 --> 07:08.780]  Describe in single words.
[07:09.340 --> 07:11.060]  Only the good things that come into your mind.
[07:11.820 --> 07:12.740]  About your mother?
[07:13.440 --> 07:13.880]  Mother?
[07:14.500 --> 07:14.840]  Yeah.
[07:16.860 --> 07:18.460]  Let me tell you about my mother.
[07:34.260 --> 07:39.120]  A new life awaits you in the most world-coloured.
[07:39.620 --> 07:45.440]  The chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
[08:11.480 --> 08:15.460]  A new life awaits you in the most world-coloured.
[08:16.160 --> 08:18.440]  The chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
[08:18.440 --> 08:18.440]  Let's go to our next adventure.
[08:18.440 --> 08:18.440]  A new life awaits you in the most world-coloured.
[08:18.440 --> 08:21.800]  The goal that land of opportunity and adventure.
[08:22.580 --> 08:23.660]  You are not going to let the show begin.
[08:23.660 --> 08:24.840]  Yes, I'm going to let the show begin.
[08:25.620 --> 08:27.540]  The custom tailored genetic model.
[08:29.780 --> 08:30.660]  The custom tailored genetic model.
[08:30.660 --> 08:31.400]  The custom tailored genetic model.
[08:31.620 --> 08:33.620]  The custom tailored genetic model.
[08:34.960 --> 08:37.380]  Nice to meet you, OK?
[08:38.280 --> 08:39.160]  We fought.
[08:39.980 --> 08:41.100]  That's a huge one, is your.
[08:41.780 --> 08:43.600]  No, four, two, two, four.
[08:44.140 --> 08:45.320]  That's a huge one, is your.
[08:45.320 --> 08:48.720]  I need it.
[08:48.720 --> 08:49.240]  I need it.
[08:49.920 --> 08:49.920]  I need it.
[08:50.720 --> 08:52.460]  I need it.
[09:01.920 --> 09:04.080]  Hey, anyone.
[09:05.500 --> 09:06.220]  Let's see.
[09:06.900 --> 09:09.400]  Admit Gommish and Engelbeet.
[09:11.480 --> 09:14.480]  He said you're under arrest, Mr. Dekker.
[09:15.480 --> 09:16.780]  Got the wrong guy, pal.
[09:21.640 --> 09:23.840]  He said you're pregnant.
[09:24.460 --> 09:25.420]  Tell him I'm eating.
[09:27.680 --> 09:29.240]  Any or my own.
[09:30.800 --> 09:31.580]  Brian, huh?
[09:44.480 --> 09:44.780]  I'm going to get you.
[09:44.820 --> 09:45.220]  I'm going to get you.
[09:47.880 --> 09:48.820]  Hello, three.
[09:49.560 --> 09:51.400]  I'm in the 8th, 4th,000.
[09:52.160 --> 09:52.720]  Put a proof.
[09:53.240 --> 09:53.800]  I have a signal.
[10:00.540 --> 10:04.900]  There's nothing here.
[10:04.900 --> 10:06.560]  Just watch out.
[10:11.620 --> 10:12.800]  No, no.
[10:13.040 --> 10:13.320]  I'm going to get you.
[10:16.900 --> 10:17.180]  I need it.
[10:17.180 --> 10:17.180]  I need it.
[10:17.180 --> 10:17.180]  I need it.
[10:17.180 --> 10:17.180]  No, four, one more time.
[10:20.900 --> 10:22.440]  I need it.
[10:28.900 --> 10:32.500]  Give it to me.
[10:32.680 --> 10:34.120]  I need it.
[10:34.120 --> 10:34.920]  I'm flying.
[10:36.820 --> 10:37.280]  I'm flying.
[10:38.220 --> 10:38.480]  I'm going.
[10:44.680 --> 10:46.560]  One of the tunnels that are in the tree.
[10:46.940 --> 10:47.060]  Hold.
[10:47.520 --> 10:47.960]  Look at that.
[10:50.720 --> 10:51.440]  EQ down.
[10:52.160 --> 10:53.300]  You know, extend the line.
[10:54.400 --> 10:55.620]  I'm going to the final mission.
[10:57.040 --> 10:57.960]  Now I'm flying.
[10:58.660 --> 10:59.620]  I'm going to watch you.
[11:00.140 --> 11:01.300]  Over the landing threshold.
[11:09.660 --> 11:10.860]  2-3.
[11:14.100 --> 11:15.020]  1-0.
[11:15.140 --> 11:15.860]  1-0.
[11:15.860 --> 11:19.900]  2-3.
[11:19.900 --> 11:21.840]  Are you dead?
[11:22.480 --> 11:25.460]  You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to.
[11:26.480 --> 11:27.120]  Sit down, pal.
[11:28.460 --> 11:30.080]  Don't be an asshole, Deckey.
[11:30.080 --> 11:32.920]  I've got four skin jobs walking streets.
[11:33.100 --> 11:34.120]  About a year or two.
[11:35.500 --> 11:36.920]  I know what they're doing.
[11:36.920 --> 11:37.560]  We have a street.
[11:38.020 --> 11:38.680]  We have a street.
[11:38.680 --> 11:39.720]  We have a street.
[11:39.720 --> 11:40.140]  We have a street.
[11:40.560 --> 11:40.900]  We have a street.
[11:41.560 --> 11:42.220]  We have a street.
[11:44.000 --> 11:45.280]  We have a street.
[11:46.040 --> 11:50.680]  They jumped a shuttle off-world,
[11:51.140 --> 11:52.260]  killed the crew and passengers.
[11:53.100 --> 11:55.720]  They found the shuttle drifting out the coast two weeks ago,
[11:55.820 --> 11:56.500]  so we know they're around.
[11:59.600 --> 11:59.960]  Embarrassing.
[12:00.360 --> 12:01.620]  You know, sir, not embarrassing.
[12:01.880 --> 12:03.600]  There's no one's ever going to find out they're down here.ERROR:core.transcription:Transcription failed for H:\Movies\Blade Runner 1982 Final Cut BRRip 1080p AC3 x264 TVnRG.mkv: 'charmap' codec can't encode characters in position 35-36: character maps to <undefined>

[12:04.120 --> 12:05.840]  That you're going to spot them and you're going to air them out.
[12:06.440 --> 12:07.680]  I don't work here anymore.
[12:09.380 --> 12:11.460]  Give it the hold. He's good.
[12:11.980 --> 12:14.160]  I did. You can breathe, OK?
[12:14.340 --> 12:15.280]  There's no way I'm plugs him.
[12:16.400 --> 12:17.220]  It's not good enough.
[12:18.160 --> 12:18.680]  Not good at you.
[12:19.800 --> 12:20.740]  I need you, Dex.
[12:21.580 --> 12:22.560]  This is a bad one.
[12:22.940 --> 12:23.440]  The worst yet.
[12:23.440 --> 12:25.960]  I need the old blade runner.
[12:27.020 --> 12:27.760]  I need your magic.
[12:29.580 --> 12:31.640]  It was quit when I come in here, Brian.
[12:33.360 --> 12:34.720]  I'm twice as quit now.
[12:35.460 --> 12:36.480]  Stop right where you are.
[12:37.260 --> 12:38.180]  You know the score, pal?
[12:39.160 --> 12:40.740]  You're not caught. You're little people.
[12:53.440 --> 12:54.440]  No choice, huh?
[12:56.600 --> 12:57.360]  No choice, pal?
[12:58.400 --> 13:00.060]  I already had an IQ test, I sure.
[13:01.820 --> 13:03.300]  I'm thinking I'd rather have one of these.
[13:04.100 --> 13:06.500]  Reaction times the factor in this, so please pay attention.
[13:06.960 --> 13:08.240]  Answer as quickly as you can.
[13:08.440 --> 13:08.660]  Sure.
[13:09.960 --> 13:11.440]  1187 at Hunter Buster.
[13:12.880 --> 13:13.600]  That's the hotel.
[13:14.280 --> 13:14.440]  What?
[13:15.220 --> 13:15.900]  Where I live.
[13:16.580 --> 13:16.960]  Nice place.
[13:17.620 --> 13:18.300]  I'm not sure, I guess.
[13:19.080 --> 13:21.580]  There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
[13:21.580 --> 13:23.780]  Six replicants, three males, three female.
[13:24.400 --> 13:26.800]  They slaughtered 23 people and jumped a shut off.
[13:27.520 --> 13:29.420]  An aerial patrol spotted the ship off the coast.
[13:29.700 --> 13:30.060]  No crew.
[13:30.440 --> 13:31.000]  No sight of them.
[13:31.980 --> 13:34.700]  Three nights ago, they tried to break into Thai rail cooperation.
[13:35.180 --> 13:37.320]  Two of them got fried, running through electrical fuel.
[13:37.620 --> 13:38.320]  We lost the others.
[13:40.200 --> 13:43.520]  On the possibility they might try to infiltrate his employees,
[13:44.040 --> 13:47.700]  I had Hodengover and run Voic Comptest and the new workers.
[13:48.480 --> 13:50.080]  Looks like he got himself one.
[13:50.080 --> 13:52.320]  Say you're looked down, you see a tortoise.
[13:52.720 --> 13:53.760]  It's crawling towards you.
[13:54.460 --> 13:54.840]  Tortoise.
[13:54.900 --> 13:55.380]  That's Leon.
[13:56.100 --> 13:57.820]  Ammunition loader on an neglected run.
[13:58.020 --> 14:00.860]  You can lift 400 pond atomic loads all day and night.
[14:01.560 --> 14:03.120]  The only way you can hurt a music kiln.
[14:03.820 --> 14:04.580]  Well, I don't get it.
[14:04.660 --> 14:06.200]  What are their risks coming back to Earth for?
[14:06.320 --> 14:06.920]  That's unusual.
[14:07.200 --> 14:07.340]  Why?
[14:08.360 --> 14:10.260]  What do they want out of the Thai rail cooperation?
[14:11.380 --> 14:12.940]  You tell me, pal, I put your hair for.
[14:25.240 --> 14:26.220]  What's this?
[14:26.660 --> 14:27.480]  Nexus 6.
[14:28.080 --> 14:28.640]  Roy Batty.
[14:29.320 --> 14:30.720]  Incept date 2016.
[14:31.600 --> 14:32.400]  Combat model.
[14:32.720 --> 14:33.760]  Optimum self-sufficiency.
[14:35.280 --> 14:36.400]  Probably the leader.
[14:40.440 --> 14:41.800]  This is Zora.
[14:42.500 --> 14:45.180]  She's trained for an off-world kick-murder squad.
[14:46.020 --> 14:47.300]  Talk about beauty and the beast.
[14:47.920 --> 14:48.620]  She's both.
[14:53.680 --> 14:55.900]  The fourth skin job is Priss.
[14:56.500 --> 14:57.600]  A basic pleasure model.
[14:58.040 --> 15:00.800]  The standard item for military clubs in the auto-conies.
[15:02.260 --> 15:05.740]  They would design the coffee human beings in every way except their emotions.
[15:06.980 --> 15:11.400]  The design is reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own emotional responses.
[15:12.900 --> 15:15.000]  Well, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
[15:15.600 --> 15:17.140]  So they build in a fail-safe device.
[15:17.720 --> 15:18.320]  Which is what?
[15:18.320 --> 15:19.800]  For your lifespan.
[15:27.140 --> 15:30.340]  Now there's a Nexus 6 over the Thai rail cooperation.
[15:31.120 --> 15:32.600]  I want you to go and put the machine on.
[15:33.120 --> 15:34.400]  And if the machine doesn't work?
[15:55.100 --> 15:57.660]  This isn't

[00:21.820 --> 00:23.220]  I
[00:32.400 --> 00:47.260]  Number seven first order
[00:47.260 --> 00:59.400]  Two of them
[00:59.400 --> 00:59.400]  63
[00:59.400 --> 00:59.400]  Team
[00:59.400 --> 00:59.980]  87
[00:59.980 --> 00:59.980]  asking
[00:59.980 --> 00:59.980]  insane
[01:09.640 --> 01:10.280]  What up?
[01:10.360 --> 01:11.180]  Do you need any homework?
[01:11.680 --> 01:12.240]  One homework.
[01:12.700 --> 01:13.800]  Not for you. Yeah, I did it.
[01:13.960 --> 01:14.680]  Can't copy it?
[01:14.920 --> 01:15.580]  Hell no.
[01:15.840 --> 01:16.740]  Two extra to done.
[01:17.640 --> 01:19.280]  Did you all hear the shooting last night?
[01:19.980 --> 01:20.840]  Yeah, I heard it.
[01:21.020 --> 01:21.900]  I got it on my baby.
[01:22.320 --> 01:23.740]  Man, you was scary, can't you?
[01:24.100 --> 01:24.940]  My mama say,
[01:25.460 --> 01:27.620]  a bullet don't have no name on it.
[01:27.760 --> 01:28.740]  I ain't afraid to get shot.
[01:28.940 --> 01:29.980]  Both my buzzers were shot.
[01:29.980 --> 01:29.980]  I'm not afraid to get shot.
[01:29.980 --> 01:29.980]  I'm not afraid to get shot.
[01:29.980 --> 01:29.980]  I'm not afraid to get shot.
[01:29.980 --> 01:29.980]  I'm not afraid to get shot.
[01:29.980 --> 01:29.980]  I'm not afraid to get shot.
[01:29.980 --> 01:29.980]  I'm not afraid to get shot.
[01:29.980 --> 01:29.980]  I'm not afraid to get shot.
[01:29.980 --> 01:29.980]  Can't copy it?
[01:29.980 --> 01:31.540]  They still alive. They lucky.
[01:34.680 --> 01:35.940]  You all want to see something?
[01:37.140 --> 01:37.520]  Come on.
[01:38.780 --> 01:40.720]  I ain't singing what? You want to see it or not?
[02:29.980 --> 02:30.860]  Is that blood?
[02:31.500 --> 02:32.220]  What happened?
[02:33.060 --> 02:33.700]  What do you think?
[02:34.040 --> 02:34.700]  Somebody got a smoke.
[02:34.900 --> 02:35.820]  Look at the hole in the wall.
[02:36.040 --> 02:36.260]  Stupid.
[02:37.160 --> 02:39.040]  These second two on my times tables.
[02:40.040 --> 02:42.580]  Look, why is the blood turning yellow?
[02:43.140 --> 02:45.200]  That's why it was separation from the plasma.
[02:46.640 --> 02:49.840]  So that's how the settlers survived that long hard winter.
[02:50.380 --> 02:51.880]  That took so many of their lives.
[02:51.880 --> 02:55.220]  Just by eating all those special foods that were given to them,
[02:55.360 --> 02:58.860]  like the turkey and the squash.
[02:58.860 --> 03:03.960]  And all the foods that we think of as our traditional holiday meal.
[03:04.560 --> 03:07.740]  And that's why we celebrate Thanksgiving
[03:07.740 --> 03:11.620]  in order to commemorate the unity between the Indians,
[03:12.380 --> 03:14.960]  excuse me, the Native Americans,
[03:15.900 --> 03:19.260]  and the early English settlers who were called,
[03:19.760 --> 03:20.200]  glass,
[03:21.340 --> 03:22.140]  Pillars.
[03:23.060 --> 03:25.160]  That's right, the pilgrims are very good.
[03:25.640 --> 03:26.560]  The penguins.
[03:28.340 --> 03:29.640]  Who said that?
[03:31.220 --> 03:32.500]  Mr. Stiles.
[03:33.580 --> 03:34.080]  There's me.
[03:34.440 --> 03:36.700]  How is it you always have something funny to say?
[03:37.400 --> 03:38.160]  Because I'm a committee.
[03:41.060 --> 03:43.420]  Would you like to come up and teach the class?
[03:45.680 --> 03:46.700]  Yeah, I can do that.
[03:47.300 --> 03:49.080]  Very well, come on up and struck us.
[03:56.560 --> 03:58.380]  And what will be the basis of your lecture?
[03:59.060 --> 03:59.320]  What?
[04:00.340 --> 04:02.380]  What are you going to talk about?
[04:03.020 --> 04:04.580]  Tell you if you let me talk, shoes.
[04:07.040 --> 04:07.440]  Shh.
[04:09.280 --> 04:11.880]  Okay, all right, does anybody know what the name of this place is?
[04:12.100 --> 04:13.540]  That's Africa. I know that.
[04:13.880 --> 04:14.940]  That's right, that's Africa.
[04:15.500 --> 04:18.540]  But did you know that Africa is a place where the body of the first mayor was found?
[04:19.580 --> 04:22.220]  My daddy says that most of the place were all people who were in the Native family.
[04:22.580 --> 04:24.220]  That means everybody's really from Africa.
[04:24.220 --> 04:25.180]  Everybody.
[04:26.060 --> 04:28.060]  Oh, yeah, everybody.
[04:28.720 --> 04:31.340]  I'm from Africa. I'm from Kring, John Matthews.
[04:34.720 --> 04:36.120]  Like a nice African.
[04:36.980 --> 04:38.540]  I'm from Africa. You're from Africa.
[04:38.720 --> 04:40.260]  You're African, booty scratcher.
[04:42.100 --> 04:45.000]  I'm going to get your ass.
[04:45.860 --> 04:47.920]  Okay, boys, that's enough. Come to Tenon, Big Brother.
[04:48.380 --> 04:50.200]  I'll get my brother's shoe to the face.
[04:50.200 --> 04:51.400]  That's right, that's right.
[04:52.240 --> 04:54.500]  I'll get my dad. He's like God, one motherfucker.
[04:55.040 --> 04:55.460]  That's right.
[04:55.620 --> 04:55.620]  That's right.
[04:55.620 --> 04:56.800]  Ain't nobody's big.
[04:57.020 --> 04:57.140]  That's right.
[04:57.200 --> 04:58.820]  Are you listening to me sit down?
[04:59.500 --> 04:59.820]  Sit down.
[05:00.080 --> 05:00.540]  Sit down.
[05:03.900 --> 05:06.600]  As I was saying, he's highly intelligent.
[05:07.020 --> 05:08.380]  He's enormous vocabulary.
[05:09.460 --> 05:11.040]  It's just that...
[05:11.040 --> 05:12.840]  Yes, go on.
[05:13.400 --> 05:16.460]  Just that he has a very bad temper.
[05:16.460 --> 05:21.140]  It makes it extremely difficult for him to interact with the other children.
[05:21.400 --> 05:24.900]  And perhaps I could recommend a therapy or a child's psychologist.
[05:25.180 --> 05:27.520]  No, thank you. We can manage just fine.
[05:28.080 --> 05:30.880]  Is there some problem in the home? Are you employed?
[05:32.380 --> 05:33.900]  That's really none of your business.
[05:34.300 --> 05:35.820]  But since you asked, I am employed,
[05:35.980 --> 05:37.820]  and I'm studying to receive my master's degree.
[05:38.120 --> 05:39.180]  Then you are educated.
[05:39.380 --> 05:41.920]  Listen, are we going to talk about me or my son?
[05:42.420 --> 05:43.000]  I'm sorry.
[05:44.520 --> 05:47.860]  Well, we'll be happy to see Tray back in class on Tuesday.
[05:48.980 --> 05:51.000]  His suspension was only for three days, you know?
[05:51.620 --> 05:53.580]  No, I don't think you'll be seeing Tray again.
[05:53.900 --> 05:55.280]  And why is that man asked?
[05:55.560 --> 05:58.440]  Because Tray is going to live with his father.
[05:58.680 --> 05:59.380]  His father?
[05:59.620 --> 06:00.620]  Yes, his father.
[06:00.920 --> 06:03.640]  Or did you think we made babies by ourselves?
[06:06.560 --> 06:08.120]  Tell her to go jump in the lake, mom.
[06:08.820 --> 06:10.020]  What was our agreement?
[06:10.020 --> 06:12.180]  What did we put down in writing?
[06:17.260 --> 06:20.560]  I, Tray's styles, being of sound mind and body,
[06:20.800 --> 06:22.360]  agree not to get into any disputes
[06:22.360 --> 06:25.660]  whether physical or verbal for the rest of the school year.
[06:26.060 --> 06:27.760]  If I do not conform to this agreement,
[06:28.440 --> 06:32.460]  I will go to live with my father, Mr. Furious Stimes.
[06:34.400 --> 06:36.220]  Signed, oh now who wrote this?
[06:38.700 --> 06:39.860]  Tray's styles.
[06:43.300 --> 06:45.340]  You have to work on your handwriting.
[06:57.500 --> 06:58.540]  I just don't want to see you end up dead.
[06:58.540 --> 06:58.540]  Or in jail.
[06:58.540 --> 06:58.540]  A drunk standing in front of one of these liquor stores.
[06:58.540 --> 06:59.840]  Can you please go back to your seat?
[07:01.620 --> 07:03.060]  I'm going to go back to my seat.
[07:03.520 --> 07:04.180]  I'm going to go back to my seat.
[07:05.300 --> 07:07.360]  I just don't want to see you end up dead.
[07:08.400 --> 07:09.240]  Or in jail.
[07:10.880 --> 07:13.960]  A drunk standing in front of one of these liquor stores.
[07:14.960 --> 07:16.040]  Can you understand that?
[07:20.200 --> 07:22.120]  Look at me, I'm serious.
[07:24.960 --> 07:25.680]  I love you.
[07:26.800 --> 07:27.940]  You're my only son.
[07:43.960 --> 07:46.960]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[07:47.700 --> 07:48.560]  I'm sorry.
[08:02.280 --> 08:03.780]  How you doing?
[08:04.400 --> 08:06.300]  I'm fine. How about yourself?
[08:06.660 --> 08:07.880]  I'm living that's enough for me.
[08:11.160 --> 08:12.480]  Oh, here he is.
[08:18.080 --> 08:19.300]  What's the matter, you can't say hi.
[08:24.360 --> 08:25.640]  Go ahead, talk to your friend.
[08:39.640 --> 08:40.960]  There goes your son.
[08:45.320 --> 08:46.840]  You wanted him, you got him.
[08:49.360 --> 08:50.980]  Why are you trying to make this so easy?
[08:53.440 --> 08:54.960]  Well, this is like you told me.
[08:56.700 --> 08:58.240]  I can't teach him how to be a man.
[09:00.300 --> 09:00.940]  That's your job.
[09:04.460 --> 09:06.760]  So I didn't know we could bring him more, huh?
[09:07.360 --> 09:08.360]  You stand for good.
[09:09.620 --> 09:10.920]  Chris, you don't try, right?
[09:11.400 --> 09:12.840]  Remember that time when playing ball out there?
[09:13.580 --> 09:14.500]  Yeah, I remember you.
[09:14.820 --> 09:16.540]  You didn't want to collect all those comic books.
[09:16.980 --> 09:17.680]  You living here now?
[09:21.640 --> 09:22.420]  Thank you, Rick.
[09:24.600 --> 09:25.380]  Here he is.
[09:29.600 --> 09:30.540]  Care my baby.
[09:30.920 --> 09:32.060]  He is my baby, too.
[09:34.400 --> 09:35.940]  You still collect comic books?
[09:37.420 --> 09:39.940]  Why does food got more comics than no mother fuckers?
[09:40.100 --> 09:40.380]  That's right.
[09:41.220 --> 09:42.660]  Come here. Watch my stuff.
[09:46.940 --> 09:48.040]  What up, try?
[09:49.160 --> 09:49.640]  Sorry.
[09:52.320 --> 09:55.300]  Well, it looks like you got all your friends over here.
[09:58.640 --> 10:00.180]  When you come to pick me up.
[10:05.400 --> 10:07.620]  Listen, this is just a temporary thing.
[10:08.460 --> 10:10.440]  When I get out of school, I get a better job,
[10:10.460 --> 10:11.600]  but better place to stay.
[10:12.860 --> 10:13.780]  Maybe I house.
[10:14.920 --> 10:16.960]  Then you can come back and things will be better.
[10:17.980 --> 10:18.060]  Okay?
[10:19.520 --> 10:19.980]  Okay.
[10:22.260 --> 10:22.960]  Can I kiss?
[10:26.300 --> 10:27.920]  I love you, I love you.
[10:28.320 --> 10:28.800]  Me too.
[10:29.900 --> 10:31.200]  So, Doboy, you staying on the trouble?
[10:31.620 --> 10:33.280]  Trouble. I got no trouble.
[10:33.740 --> 10:34.360]  You got some trouble?
[10:35.120 --> 10:36.400]  That's a long trouble, aren't you?
[10:36.460 --> 10:37.420]  I'll write these leaves off for me.
[10:37.800 --> 10:38.160]  How much?
[10:38.560 --> 10:41.180]  I give you $5 for the whole lawn with not one leaf on it.
[10:42.260 --> 10:42.940]  Five times.
[10:43.740 --> 10:45.020]  Man, that ain't shit.
[10:45.560 --> 10:47.340]  How can I go in there doing that?
[10:47.700 --> 10:48.640]  Oh, yeah, doing what?
[10:49.680 --> 10:50.780]  It worked for his uncle.
[10:51.500 --> 10:52.680]  Oh, well, that's too bad.
[10:52.860 --> 10:55.300]  I guess I just have to get my son to do it for me.
[10:55.580 --> 10:55.880]  What?
[10:56.560 --> 10:58.640]  Would you break up these leaves off the lawn?
[11:00.120 --> 11:03.260]  Hey, boy, don't look at me funny if I ask you to do something here.
[11:03.320 --> 11:03.660]  Take this.
[11:06.720 --> 11:08.640]  There's two trash bags right down the ground.
[11:09.380 --> 11:09.980]  See y'all later.
[11:15.260 --> 11:16.180]  Damn you, daddy.
[11:16.620 --> 11:18.340]  You worse than the boogeyman himself.
[11:19.100 --> 11:20.200]  I'd wall these leaves.
[11:20.560 --> 11:21.240]  Who do you think he is?
[11:21.420 --> 11:21.980]  Come to get that?
[11:23.040 --> 11:23.720]  Better try.
[11:24.380 --> 11:24.780]  Later.
[11:26.060 --> 11:27.580]  Who would you make a boogeyman?
[11:27.980 --> 11:30.160]  Try and know if such thing is no boogeyman.
[11:30.280 --> 11:31.240]  Shut up, boogeyman.
[11:31.780 --> 11:33.840]  You can't make it up to the whole thing in a minute.
[11:36.960 --> 11:37.740]  Yeah, better.
[12:13.400 --> 12:14.260]  All right, Trey.
[12:14.860 --> 12:16.300]  I got to lay down the rules of the house.
[12:16.780 --> 12:18.400]  It's the same thing as we can, do you remember?
[12:21.880 --> 12:23.180]  All right, then, what are you?
[12:23.480 --> 12:23.700]  I'm going to have to go to the hospital.
[12:23.700 --> 12:23.700]  I'm going to have to go to the hospital.
[12:23.700 --> 12:23.700]  I'm going to have to go to the hospital.
[12:23.700 --> 12:23.700]  I'm going to have to go to the hospital.
[12:23.700 --> 12:27.580]  Clean the bathroom, sink floor, and two.
[12:28.300 --> 12:29.360]  I got clean that tub?
[12:30.180 --> 12:30.720]  Yeah.
[12:34.280 --> 12:35.440]  Clean my room.
[12:36.140 --> 12:36.660]  One along.
[12:38.520 --> 12:40.000]  I guess you're something.
[12:40.380 --> 12:40.700]  Mm-hmm.
[12:40.960 --> 12:42.580]  What do you have to do around here?
[12:47.920 --> 12:52.100]  I don't have to do nothing around here, except for pay the bills.
[12:52.800 --> 12:55.800]  Put food on the table, and put clothes on your back.
[12:56.020 --> 12:56.340]  Do you understand?
[12:57.460 --> 12:58.920]  I had to pay him a bills.
[13:01.220 --> 13:03.300]  You know, Trey, you may think I'm being hard on you right now,
[13:03.300 --> 13:03.740]  but I'm not.
[13:04.700 --> 13:06.880]  What I'm doing is I'm trying to teach you how to be responsible.
[13:08.140 --> 13:09.580]  It's like your little friends across the street
[13:09.580 --> 13:11.280]  they don't have anybody to show them how to do that.
[13:11.440 --> 13:12.780]  They don't.
[13:13.040 --> 13:14.500]  You're going to see how they end up, too.
[13:20.280 --> 13:21.460]  I'm glad you're here, Trey.
[13:23.780 --> 13:24.820]  You're a prince, you know that?
[13:26.260 --> 13:26.520]  Yeah.
[13:27.000 --> 13:27.580]  You're the prince.
[13:28.600 --> 13:29.320]  I'm the king.
[13:31.160 --> 13:34.220]  Right now, the king says it's time for the prince to go to bed.
[13:34.700 --> 13:36.660]  So get yourself together.
[13:38.020 --> 13:39.140]  See you tomorrow, okay?
[14:45.300 --> 14:47.220]  Oh, shit.
[15:24.660 --> 15:26.360]  Somebody must have been praying for that fool,
[15:27.060 --> 15:28.880]  because that's where I aimed right for his head.
[15:29.280 --> 15:30.260]  You should have blew it off.
[15:31.340 --> 15:31.940]  Don't say that.
[15:34.040 --> 15:34.840]  Don't say that.
[15:37.440 --> 15:39.700]  Just would have been contributing to killing another brother.
[15:47.100 --> 15:48.320]  And where are these fools?
[15:52.040 --> 15:53.660]  You've been waiting out here for almost an hour.
[15:53.840 --> 15:54.080]  You know that?
[16:10.840 --> 16:11.720]  I'm not here.
[16:14.100 --> 16:15.860]  We got a call of a burglary here.
[16:16.260 --> 16:17.780]  Yeah, that was about an hour ago.
[16:18.200 --> 16:18.480]  Whoa.
[16:19.340 --> 16:20.400]  We didn't ask you that.
[16:21.400 --> 16:22.300]  Yeah, well, I told you.
[16:22.980 --> 16:25.000]  So I don't like having my son out here in the cold.
[16:26.300 --> 16:27.660]  Just tell me what happened, sir.
[16:28.660 --> 16:29.820]  Well, somebody broke into the house.
[16:30.460 --> 16:32.160]  I fired at him with my piece and he ran away.
[16:33.800 --> 16:34.660]  So you didn't get it?
[16:34.940 --> 16:36.940]  Well, if I got him, he'd be laid out here in front of you, right?
[16:36.940 --> 16:39.600]  Is there anything missing?
[16:40.220 --> 16:40.360]  No.
[16:41.200 --> 16:41.560]  Good.
[16:41.920 --> 16:42.940]  I don't need to make out a report.
[16:42.980 --> 16:45.400]  I'm 12.965 with God of Fort 154s
[16:45.400 --> 16:46.400]  because of my quality.
[16:49.340 --> 16:51.100]  I know it's too bad you didn't get it.
[16:52.060 --> 16:53.760]  We won't let's niggot in the streets.
[16:54.000 --> 16:55.080]  We have to worry about it.

[18:02.660 --> 18:06.500]  You don't do shit and you never got a mouth to shit.
[18:07.080 --> 18:10.020]  All you ever do around here is eat, sleep, and shit.
[18:10.860 --> 18:11.800]  Look at this place.
[18:13.020 --> 18:14.900]  Wait y'all, I'm gonna thank God for the mate.

[18:17.300 --> 18:18.240]  Hey, I know it ain't it.
[18:18.740 --> 18:20.500]  It ain't it till I say it's his damage.

[18:55.180 --> 18:56.020]  So tell me something.
[18:56.460 --> 18:59.080]  How come your dad don't come up here and play cars with us and I'm not?
[18:59.680 --> 19:00.520]  I don't know.
[19:01.320 --> 19:03.640]  I know he don't think he better than the rest of us.
[19:04.180 --> 19:06.180]  Must be too busy shooting at people.
[19:06.620 --> 19:08.240]  I heard what happened over that other night.

[19:44.380 --> 19:45.840]  She ain't drawing, she's my woman.
[19:46.800 --> 19:48.420]  How could she be a woman when she's my lady?
[19:48.660 --> 19:49.260]  She's my wife.
[19:49.420 --> 19:52.240]  She may be a wife, but I stick my dinghy in her every night.

[25:00.600 --> 25:01.240]  Okay, then.
[25:01.980 --> 25:02.960]  What's the three rules?
[25:04.020 --> 25:04.960]  Break it down from it.

[25:08.040 --> 25:08.700]  I got it.
[25:09.360 --> 25:11.100]  I always look a person in a eye.
[25:11.100 --> 25:13.200]  You got to respect your better.
[25:14.480 --> 25:17.780]  Two words, you never be afraid to ask you for anything.
[25:18.740 --> 25:20.020]  Still isn't necessary.
[25:21.940 --> 25:23.080]  And last one I think was,
[25:24.100 --> 25:26.680]  you never respect anybody who does respect your better.
[25:27.540 --> 25:28.420]  They like me.
[25:29.440 --> 25:31.700]  Yeah, yeah, you got it.
[25:41.180 --> 25:42.460]  What do you know about sex?

[26:01.480 --> 26:02.620]  You think that's it?
[26:03.780 --> 26:04.820]  Basically, yeah.
[26:09.180 --> 26:10.460]  Well, remember this.
[26:11.940 --> 26:13.900]  Any fool with a dick can make a baby,
[26:14.020 --> 26:15.860]  but only a real man can raise his children.
[26:21.360 --> 26:23.980]  I wasn't, but 17 when your mother was pregnant with you.
[26:26.560 --> 26:29.800]  All of my friends was dropping out of high school,
[26:30.080 --> 26:32.260]  hanging out on corners in front of liquor stores,
[26:32.260 --> 26:33.660]  getting drunk, getting high.
[26:37.640 --> 26:39.120]  Some of them was robbing people.
[26:39.860 --> 26:41.280]  Some of them was even killing people.
[26:43.520 --> 26:45.400]  Hey, you remember my friend Marcus?
[26:47.900 --> 26:49.880]  Yeah, he got into robbing people,
[26:49.980 --> 26:51.300]  going to be the coming long and joining them,
[26:51.360 --> 26:54.080]  but I was like, nah, man, we're getting ready to have a son.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.180]  I knew he was going to be a boy.
[27:02.600 --> 27:04.540]  Anyway, I wanted to be somebody you could look up to.
[27:06.660 --> 27:08.400]  So I guess that's why I went to Vietnam.
[27:09.400 --> 27:10.700]  I don't ever go on the army track.
[27:11.980 --> 27:13.540]  Black men ain't got no place in the army.
[27:18.520 --> 27:18.840]  Damn.
[27:25.160 --> 27:26.460]  Why do you get all over me?
[27:27.380 --> 27:28.200]  I don't do that no more.
[27:28.480 --> 27:30.580]  Oh, wait a minute.
[27:30.580 --> 27:33.400]  Oh, listen to this song. I love this song.
[27:47.140 --> 27:48.520]  Oh, dang it.

[27:52.980 --> 27:55.220]  Nah, they're going to be the guys.
[28:01.580 --> 28:02.360]  Oh, man, we're happy.
[28:02.800 --> 28:03.560]  Oh, still.
[29:22.980 --> 29:23.780]  Oh, man.
[29:24.140 --> 29:24.140]  Oh, man.

[29:25.220 --> 29:25.220]  Oh, man.
[29:25.220 --> 29:25.220]  Oh, man.
[29:25.220 --> 29:25.220]  Oh, man.
[29:25.220 --> 29:25.220]  Oh, man.
[29:25.220 --> 29:25.220]  Oh, man.

[29:25.780 --> 29:27.140]  Now, I'll let you speak to the back here.
[29:27.140 --> 29:31.280]  Oh, there you go.
[29:31.840 --> 29:32.580]  Pull another part.
[29:36.020 --> 29:38.840]  Ricky, you're not watching this.
[29:38.880 --> 29:39.300]  Me, baby.
[29:39.340 --> 29:41.420]  You just stand here, pokin' and you gotta flip it over.
[29:41.820 --> 29:42.120]  Come on.
[29:42.620 --> 29:43.340]  Give me two weeks.
[29:43.580 --> 29:45.580]  Nah, Jenny, I gotta go back talking to your friends over there.

[29:47.700 --> 29:48.320]  He ain't wet.
[29:48.700 --> 29:49.700]  We're going back over there.
[29:50.820 --> 29:51.720]  Listen to this song.
[29:55.000 --> 29:55.760]  Uh-huh.
[29:55.760 --> 29:57.940]  See? That's how y'all got that one.
[30:00.260 --> 30:02.920]  Ricky, you make sure she's taking them pills.
[30:03.120 --> 30:03.440]  You hear me?
[30:03.680 --> 30:05.820]  Because I don't want to hold stack of these running around here.
[30:06.120 --> 30:07.280]  Because I'm going to be doing it with you.
[30:08.320 --> 30:09.420]  Give me a hand. I'll put them back.
[30:09.520 --> 30:09.760]  Come on.
[30:10.000 --> 30:10.280]  Come on.

[38:42.360 --> 38:44.320]  Hey, pop, can you fix my faith back here?
[38:44.820 --> 38:45.240]  And up here?

[39:37.260 --> 39:37.980]  I'm older than dirt.
[39:38.780 --> 39:41.880]  I ain't for 17 years older than you.
[39:42.580 --> 39:45.820]  Okay, now your friends out here, they got fathers in their 40s and 50s, man.

[40:10.060 --> 40:10.720]  Give me a dollar.
[40:11.420 --> 40:11.900]  You think so?
[40:12.740 --> 40:13.140]  Yeah.
[40:14.360 --> 40:15.180]  Wait a minute, man.
[40:17.220 --> 40:19.540]  What's all this about grandkids, man?
[40:20.280 --> 40:21.780]  You've been using the rubbers I gave you, ain't you?
[40:21.940 --> 40:22.940]  Oh, man, what is it?
[40:23.040 --> 40:24.880]  I ain't ready to be a granddaddy, all right?
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.340]  I just, I ain't ready to be a granddaddy, man.
[40:27.440 --> 40:28.200]  I ain't ready for all of that.
[40:28.640 --> 40:29.760]  Ready, one, one, five.
[40:29.960 --> 40:30.880]  I can take care of myself.
[40:31.340 --> 40:32.440]  Why you sweating, man?
[40:33.300 --> 40:35.520]  Uh, try, close your fridge.
[40:35.840 --> 40:36.560]  Close your fridge, man.
[40:36.800 --> 40:37.020]  Come in.
[40:37.020 --> 40:37.020]  Okay.
[40:37.600 --> 40:37.840]  Okay.
[40:40.260 --> 40:40.820]  Okay.

[40:54.780 --> 40:55.900]  You got some pussy here?
[40:56.560 --> 40:56.860]  What?
[40:57.240 --> 40:58.240]  You got some pussy here?
[40:58.520 --> 40:58.940]  Yeah.
[40:59.720 --> 41:00.000]  Yeah.
[41:00.000 --> 41:00.100]  Yeah.
[41:00.780 --> 41:01.220]  Wait.
[41:02.120 --> 41:02.560]  What?
[41:03.060 --> 41:03.320]  Wait.
[41:06.300 --> 41:07.160]  All right, all right.
[41:07.340 --> 41:08.320]  Just sit down.
[41:08.500 --> 41:11.100]  Sit down, man.
[41:12.760 --> 41:21.420]  It was the Sunday, right?
[41:22.180 --> 41:24.340]  Rick and I were kicking it up on Crenshaw.
[41:24.900 --> 41:26.860]  This group of females rolled up in a red.
[41:27.720 --> 41:31.600]  Everybody trying to bump Russian, trying to jibble, okay?
[41:32.320 --> 41:34.200]  Man, there was this one girl.
[41:35.060 --> 41:36.840]  Everybody was trying to rush.
[41:37.540 --> 41:38.080]  Baby.
[41:38.720 --> 41:39.040]  Yeah.
[41:39.860 --> 41:43.580]  You know, body was booming like right out of just centerfold.
[41:43.880 --> 41:47.680]  So I'm like, I'm ballin' that.
[41:47.920 --> 41:49.760]  She walks right up on me and she busts out.
[41:50.100 --> 41:51.200]  Is this your ride?
[41:52.480 --> 41:53.040]  That's it.
[41:53.560 --> 41:55.220]  Yeah, you wanna go for a ride with me?
[41:55.220 --> 41:58.120]  She says, no, I wanna drive.
[41:58.920 --> 41:59.680]  I see.
[42:00.660 --> 42:01.740]  Can you drive?
[42:01.980 --> 42:02.280]  Stick?
[42:02.960 --> 42:06.780]  She says, I can learn if you teach me.
[42:08.240 --> 42:09.560]  Well, I go in a lot.
[42:09.820 --> 42:12.760]  I'm mad at you anymore because I'm starting to get a woody in my sweats, right?
[42:13.420 --> 42:17.280]  And I say, well, why don't you give me your number and I'll call you for a lesson?
[42:19.240 --> 42:20.080]  She does.
[42:21.480 --> 42:23.560]  About a week later, I'm over at a house, right?
[42:24.340 --> 42:26.440]  I'm on my grandma leaving for church.
[42:27.940 --> 42:29.480]  I walk right up to the door.
[42:30.040 --> 42:33.000]  As soon as I go inside, boom, we go at it.
[42:33.280 --> 42:33.760]  Now I'm stuck.
[42:34.140 --> 42:35.680]  Kissing, tugging, right?
[42:35.780 --> 42:37.680]  So I pick her up, take her upstairs.
[42:41.280 --> 42:43.240]  We're about 20 minutes into it.
[42:43.700 --> 42:45.540]  Mom and grandma's come home.
[42:46.720 --> 42:48.760]  Seems grandma forgot her purse.
[42:48.760 --> 42:51.560]  I wanna make sure she has something to put in the collection plate.
[42:54.240 --> 42:57.720]  Yeah, I guess she can smell a sex in the air or something, right?
[43:03.100 --> 43:06.480]  She starts straight towards the teachers, won't she?
[43:11.460 --> 43:13.260]  That's the last episode I saw a teacher.
[43:14.840 --> 43:16.740]  You know, I call everyone once in a while.
[43:17.480 --> 43:22.600]  But when I do my grandma pick up the phone and say, she can't talk right now.
[43:23.020 --> 43:24.820]  She busy doing the dishes.
[43:28.740 --> 43:29.440]  What'd you use?
[43:30.940 --> 43:32.500]  I used the number she gave me.
[43:35.900 --> 43:37.280]  No, why are you sweating me?
[43:37.740 --> 43:39.780]  I had to use nothing. She said she was on the pill.
[43:41.960 --> 43:42.360]  Yeah.
[43:46.080 --> 43:50.560]  How many times I tell you, if a girl tells you she's on the pill, you use something anyway.
[43:55.380 --> 43:57.540]  Pilling will keep you dick from falling off.
[44:01.140 --> 44:05.500]  I was gonna stay while you insist on learning things in the hardware trade, but you're gonna learn.
[44:06.100 --> 44:07.120]  Oh yeah, you're gonna learn.
[44:11.240 --> 44:12.280]  Clean up the head.
[44:23.960 --> 44:28.040]  Hey, man, what the fuck is wrong with you?
[44:28.560 --> 44:32.220]  What? You saw him in my door like some kind of grill on a football field.
[44:32.800 --> 44:34.160]  Damn, make it worse than all with you.
[44:34.960 --> 44:35.240]  Nothing.
[44:42.120 --> 44:43.620]  I'm gonna go get some water.
[44:44.520 --> 44:45.380]  Guess what, man?
[44:46.660 --> 44:48.560]  We're cooking for Mercedes coming over tonight.
[44:49.440 --> 44:49.640]  Cool.
[44:50.840 --> 44:52.640]  You know, man, I never lied to my father.
[44:53.860 --> 44:54.380]  Never?
[44:56.180 --> 44:57.420]  Well, almost never.
[45:00.500 --> 45:01.540]  Where's all this coming from?
[45:02.260 --> 45:03.380]  Where's all this coming from?
[45:04.840 --> 45:08.880]  I lied to pop yesterday, telling my wife no virgin.
[45:08.880 --> 45:10.880]  We ain't a virgin, yeah?
[45:12.520 --> 45:13.100]  Is it?
[45:14.640 --> 45:16.640]  Well, technically speaking, I haven't.
[45:17.380 --> 45:24.680]  You know, I, uh, think of a couple of honeys and sucked on some titties, but I ain't never stuck an end there.
[45:24.840 --> 45:25.080]  Whatever.
[45:26.140 --> 45:27.280]  Don't you really wanna know?
[45:27.800 --> 45:29.140]  Yeah, I asked you, didn't I?
[45:31.560 --> 45:32.600]  I was afraid.
[45:37.840 --> 45:39.140]  Oh, shit.
[45:39.300 --> 45:39.580]  Get off.
[45:48.480 --> 45:49.860]  Whatcha doin, man?
[45:50.360 --> 45:50.620]  Shadow.
[45:54.640 --> 45:56.120]  Whatcha afraid of, man?
[45:57.080 --> 45:58.440]  I'm being a daddy.
[45:59.760 --> 46:00.460]  Oh.
[46:01.900 --> 46:02.260]  Yeah.
[46:02.700 --> 46:04.420]  Well, I'm getting old now, see?
[46:05.000 --> 46:08.180]  And now that I wanna flap some skins, brandy, and even down for it.
[46:08.820 --> 46:11.160]  Even if I wear a Jimmy's chain down for it.
[46:11.500 --> 46:12.040]  Is that right?
[46:13.940 --> 46:17.540]  Just me and you, ooh, man, you man.
[46:18.000 --> 46:19.620]  I saw you just the next day, next day, next day, next day.
[46:19.700 --> 46:20.040]  Straight up.
[46:20.480 --> 46:21.240]  No, thank you, man.
[46:21.860 --> 46:22.580]  Oh, no, no.
[46:22.840 --> 46:24.040]  Shit, some meat, please.
[46:25.440 --> 46:26.160]  What the fuck?
[46:26.160 --> 46:28.900]  Just that, just me and you.
[46:29.600 --> 46:30.800]  I feel so see that.
[46:30.960 --> 46:32.440]  Yeah, well, why the silent treatment?
[46:32.720 --> 46:34.640]  You haven't talked to me in five days.
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.340]  I call your house and you tell your father to say you're not home.
[46:37.600 --> 46:39.840]  Then I call a guinea, you take the phone off the hook.
[46:40.040 --> 46:41.460]  Well, I've been busy.
[46:41.680 --> 46:45.360]  Oh, well, don't give me no ball-ass excuse for a lie like that.
[46:46.560 --> 46:47.600]  What did I do, Trey?
[46:47.860 --> 46:50.800]  What did I do that was so bad that you just had to stop talking to me.
[46:50.880 --> 46:51.820]  See, you know what you did.
[46:52.320 --> 46:53.700]  See, you gotta give it to a program.
[46:54.560 --> 46:54.960]  Hmm?
[46:55.320 --> 46:56.740]  I told you about that.
[46:57.340 --> 46:59.640]  I'm Catholic and it goes against my morals.
[47:00.040 --> 47:00.820]  Yeah, I know you did.
[47:01.300 --> 47:04.080]  But Catholic girls are supposed to be one of the biggest hoop cheese.
[47:05.140 --> 47:06.520]  When you close the cameras, the boys.
[47:06.620 --> 47:07.980]  They just put the cap in the back, like,
[47:08.080 --> 47:08.940]  Oh, man, man.
[47:09.240 --> 47:10.380]  Shit, come on, you bastard.
[47:11.140 --> 47:12.060]  Shit, come on, man.
[47:12.200 --> 47:13.980]  Shit, come on, man.
[47:14.100 --> 47:16.200]  Shit, come on, man.
[47:16.240 --> 47:17.280]  Shit, come on, man.
[47:17.280 --> 47:23.680]  Shit, come on, man.
[47:23.680 --> 47:25.840]  Fuck me and the kiddie.
[47:26.700 --> 47:29.420]  Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
[47:29.420 --> 47:31.440]  Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
[47:31.440 --> 47:33.220]  I'm here to meet no bad.
[47:34.540 --> 47:37.500]  You say you want to wait till you get married first, right?
[47:38.420 --> 47:39.320]  Oh, look at me, right?
[47:40.120 --> 47:40.520]  Yes.
[47:41.100 --> 47:44.300]  And I say that I'm going to be the one who married you.
[47:46.320 --> 47:49.440]  So technically, it don't make no difference whether we do it now or later.
[47:49.520 --> 47:50.820]  We're still going to get married, right?
[47:51.380 --> 47:54.180]  Yeah, but I want to go to college before I get married.
[47:54.320 --> 47:56.920]  And there ain't no guarantee that I'm going to marry you.
[47:58.700 --> 47:59.160]  Let's go.
[47:59.160 --> 48:02.420]  Come on, man.
[48:04.360 --> 48:05.900]  Shit, come on, man.
[48:06.560 --> 48:08.740]  Shit, come on, man.
[48:08.740 --> 48:08.960]  Shit, come on, man.
[48:09.820 --> 48:10.480]  Shit, come on, man.
[48:10.480 --> 48:10.980]  Shit, come on, man.
[48:10.980 --> 48:11.820]  Hey, hey, y'all.
[48:12.000 --> 48:12.600]  You know what I mean?
[48:15.220 --> 48:16.820]  She's got a gang of asses.
[48:16.920 --> 48:19.780]  She's got a gang of asses.
[48:19.780 --> 48:21.120]  Let's do the locals, man.

[48:27.260 --> 48:27.920]  What up, baby?
[48:28.760 --> 48:30.280]  It's a little bit like the stuff off that egg.
[48:32.840 --> 48:33.540]  You got a phone.
[48:34.060 --> 48:35.660]  Oh, you're going to be the guy, yeah?
[48:36.120 --> 48:37.040]  Oh, baby.
[48:38.960 --> 48:40.940]  She's wearing foul chains to you.
[48:41.220 --> 48:42.760]  Don't worry about taking the baby.
[48:43.320 --> 48:44.540]  Just me and you.
[48:45.840 --> 48:47.620]  You haven't even given me a ring.
[48:47.620 --> 48:49.860]  Well, I ain't ready for all that, yeah.
[48:50.300 --> 48:52.340]  Oh, but you're ready to act like we're married though, right?
[48:59.180 --> 49:00.600]  Which you're mad at, so.
[49:00.720 --> 49:01.640]  Don't touch me.

[49:21.480 --> 49:22.820]  I missed you too.
[49:36.040 --> 49:37.720]  You're still ain't fucker yet.
[49:46.740 --> 49:48.940]  You better take your ass to the store with that.
[49:49.520 --> 49:50.920]  See, you're getting the skins of work.
[49:52.400 --> 49:54.240]  No, that's not all I think about.
[49:55.760 --> 49:56.160]  Yeah.
[49:57.540 --> 49:57.940]  Okay.
[49:58.940 --> 49:59.340]  Stop!
[50:00.040 --> 50:00.220]  Yo!
[50:01.020 --> 50:02.660]  Raise my arm, say you're cute.
[50:03.620 --> 50:05.960]  Ask her how come she don't say hi when I speak to her.
[50:07.040 --> 50:09.320]  He's the outcome she don't say how I want to speak to her.
[50:11.160 --> 50:11.560]  Yeah.
[50:11.560 --> 50:16.440]  Hey, I'm supposed to be talking to you and I pass some messages.

[51:18.440 --> 51:20.340]  The weekends are supposed to be our time together.
[51:22.720 --> 51:24.580]  Have you thought about what we talked about?
[51:26.200 --> 51:26.760]  Yeah.
[51:28.220 --> 51:28.780]  And?
[51:30.340 --> 51:31.380]  I don't know you.

[51:59.760 --> 52:00.740]  Look, I don't know.
[52:00.900 --> 52:01.900]  I don't think that's necessary.

[52:08.860 --> 52:11.220]  I'm sorry, but I think it's a big deal.
[52:11.760 --> 52:14.360]  There's no reason for him to come live with you now.
[52:15.560 --> 52:16.720]  It's not a baby.
[52:18.200 --> 52:18.700]  No.
[52:19.280 --> 52:20.860]  No. Wait a minute.

[52:22.740 --> 52:24.260]  No, I don't have an attitude.
[52:24.500 --> 52:25.280]  You have an attitude.

[52:27.940 --> 52:29.320]  I always tell you.
[52:29.620 --> 52:30.100]  Use the rubber.

[53:10.200 --> 53:11.580]  The machine liked that brick, though.
[53:12.700 --> 53:14.340]  Because they got different daddies, that's why.
[53:14.860 --> 53:16.080]  You're not gonna get the fuck out.

[53:34.880 --> 53:35.540]  Who the hell?
[54:05.560 --> 54:08.180]  Everybody know where Ricky Baker lives?
[54:09.120 --> 54:10.480]  That's my brother.
[54:11.040 --> 54:11.600]  You live here.
[54:12.080 --> 54:12.580]  At your way.
[54:14.000 --> 54:14.840]  Stop.
[54:17.840 --> 54:18.680]  Stop.
[54:18.680 --> 54:19.280]  I'm not whole still.

[54:22.240 --> 54:24.200]  Don't worry. Just out of here.
[54:24.880 --> 54:26.900]  Ricky, come on out of the bathroom, baby.
[54:29.060 --> 54:30.780]  Check this out. Come and grab it.
[54:35.900 --> 54:37.160]  So what college you for?
[54:38.000 --> 54:39.260]  I'm from USC.
[54:40.400 --> 54:42.420]  Yo, man, you gotta have a scholarship to go to USC.
[54:43.680 --> 54:44.680]  No, but it helps.
[54:45.560 --> 54:47.600]  Yo, you think you can hook me up with a scholarship?
[54:48.380 --> 54:50.920]  What do you do? I used to play baseball.
[54:51.920 --> 54:52.880]  You're not a man.
[54:54.380 --> 54:56.040]  I'm just not a man's ball business.
[54:57.100 --> 54:57.820]  Move, Niggas.
[54:59.080 --> 54:59.700]  Move, huh?
[55:00.960 --> 55:01.400]  Move.
[55:06.460 --> 55:07.980]  You know, being a fuck choir.
[55:08.780 --> 55:09.220]  Hello.
[55:09.880 --> 55:12.220]  Hello, I'm Lewis Crump. You must be Ricky's mother.
[55:12.700 --> 55:13.180]  Brenda.
[55:13.680 --> 55:16.080]  And this is my other son, Darren.
[55:16.580 --> 55:17.020]  Hello, Darren.
[55:18.020 --> 55:19.960]  Can I get you something to drink?
[55:20.520 --> 55:22.040]  Coffee, water, soda?
[55:22.340 --> 55:23.140]  No, no, thank you.
[55:23.280 --> 55:25.520]  You're not the game against Washington, right?
[55:26.020 --> 55:27.580]  Yes, I remember. That was a good game.
[55:27.700 --> 55:30.720]  You picked up 276 yards in a game, huh?
[55:31.060 --> 55:32.000]  That's pretty impressive.
[55:32.760 --> 55:34.420]  Why don't you all sit and talk?
[55:36.840 --> 55:37.320]  Hey.
[55:55.220 --> 55:56.020]  Come on.
[55:57.400 --> 55:59.580]  Now, I just want you to know where Andrews
[55:59.580 --> 56:00.780]  didn't you come into the campus.
[56:01.180 --> 56:04.140]  Get a good look around. You know, a field for the school as a whole.
[56:10.760 --> 56:11.660]  Here's my tape.
[56:17.740 --> 56:19.800]  And that was against Banning, my junior year.
[56:21.780 --> 56:24.260]  Man, we lost that year, but I did pretty well in yards.
[56:26.140 --> 56:28.140]  Man, the best defense in the city that year.
[56:32.220 --> 56:35.160]  Big country booty, big country titties.
[56:36.040 --> 56:36.500]  Booyah!
[56:37.120 --> 56:38.120]  That's what I'm saying.
[56:38.700 --> 56:40.740]  For me, not all that cornbread and shit, I guess.
[56:43.640 --> 56:46.720]  Shit, me. I go to college just for the house.
[56:47.280 --> 56:49.180]  Well, you don't go to college, be talking on bitches.
[56:50.080 --> 56:51.820]  Your black ass pose being learned or something.
[56:52.540 --> 56:54.820]  Can't like shit talking on stupid ass bitches.
[56:59.560 --> 57:01.020]  Yo, check out the day to end.
[57:01.440 --> 57:02.340]  Damn that shit, bro.
[57:02.900 --> 57:03.200]  I know.
[57:03.720 --> 57:05.960]  What do you interested in beside playing ball?
[57:08.620 --> 57:09.400]  Like what you mean?
[57:09.860 --> 57:11.980]  I mean, what would you want to major in?
[57:12.400 --> 57:14.180]  What kind of degree would you like to pursue?
[57:14.760 --> 57:18.020]  I'm just asking because you know there's a strong possibility
[57:18.020 --> 57:20.680]  that you won't go into the NFL after college.
[57:21.320 --> 57:22.940]  Just a fact, it happens.
[57:24.220 --> 57:25.660]  And it ain't that before.
[57:27.840 --> 57:29.820]  Well, actually I was thinking about majoring in business.
[57:30.700 --> 57:33.920]  Yeah, I got this friend of yours always talking about going into business.
[57:35.060 --> 57:36.040]  Plus, I like computers.
[57:36.720 --> 57:37.380]  Maybe I could do that.
[57:38.400 --> 57:38.880]  What do you think?
[57:40.020 --> 57:43.000]  Young brother, I think you could do anything you put your mind to.
[57:49.400 --> 57:51.080]  I tell you what you all need to go.
[57:52.100 --> 57:54.200]  Where they got my women and any women.
[57:55.180 --> 57:55.980]  Violence, too.
[57:57.000 --> 57:57.960]  Krishaw's Sunday night.
[57:58.080 --> 58:00.340]  No. Street races on floors.
[58:00.980 --> 58:02.720]  Nah, nigga, y'all way off.
[58:03.400 --> 58:04.420]  I give y'all a hint.

[58:17.380 --> 58:19.500]  Ain't nobody going to church to catch no pitches.
[58:20.600 --> 58:23.780]  I should borrow your ass, buff this porch, that stupid shit.
[58:26.100 --> 58:31.040]  So basically you have a 2.3 overall GPA, according to the classes, we require.
[58:31.840 --> 58:33.880]  All you have to do is take the SAT test.
[58:35.120 --> 58:35.560]  Yeah.
[58:36.420 --> 58:37.600]  I heard about that test.
[58:38.800 --> 58:43.080]  The next one's being offered, let's see, um, early October.
[58:43.780 --> 58:44.580]  Are you going to take it?
[58:45.280 --> 58:45.900]  I guess so.
[58:46.420 --> 58:47.860]  Man, can't get into college without it, right?
[58:47.860 --> 58:51.120]  Just remember, all you have to do is get over a 700.
[58:52.620 --> 58:53.060]  Okay.
[58:53.420 --> 58:54.000]  Come here.
[58:54.220 --> 58:54.880]  Come here.
[58:56.020 --> 58:56.680]  I'm sorry.
[58:56.840 --> 58:57.920]  You're trying to give it a bit.
[59:02.100 --> 59:03.040]  You're a little brother?
[59:04.520 --> 59:05.400]  Uh, son.
[59:09.980 --> 59:13.500]  Well, well, I look forward to talking to you again.
[59:14.200 --> 59:16.160]  And we'll also arrange that to a 4.
[59:16.460 --> 59:17.280]  Thank you, Mr. Krone.
[59:18.840 --> 59:19.720]  You better hurry.
[59:20.060 --> 59:20.600]  Bye-bye.
[59:25.400 --> 59:26.080]  Yo, man.
[59:26.500 --> 59:29.760]  Well, keep me down with scholarship and work, because you know I want to go to college too.
[59:29.960 --> 59:31.340]  You mess with the fuck up, man.
[59:32.000 --> 59:33.080]  Fuck, you dig a little bit.
[59:33.080 --> 59:33.860]  Look, it's my porch.
[59:33.860 --> 59:35.280]  You can take your dumb ass home.
[59:35.700 --> 59:37.720]  My baby is going to a university.
[59:40.680 --> 59:43.500]  I always knew you would amount to something.
[59:44.300 --> 59:44.620]  I did.
[59:45.500 --> 59:49.080]  When you were a little boy, you used to run around here all the time with that football in your hand.
[59:49.160 --> 59:49.700]  You remember that?
[59:51.600 --> 59:52.720]  I'm proud of you, baby.
[59:53.900 --> 59:54.520]  You're a small.
[59:55.420 --> 59:56.580]  You make your mom a breakfast.
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.720]  By my hand, reattention, please.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.940]  The SAT test will be administered in this room.
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:10.460]  When you receive your test book, please keep it closed on your desk.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.940]  Read the directions on the front cover of your test book.
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:17.940]  You have to use a number two pencil and marking your answer sheet.
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.840]  Encore ballpoint ten is not to be used.
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:27.880]  At this time, if you do not have a number two pencil with you, please raise your hand and keep it up.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.780]  We'll pass a pencil out to you.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:34.840]  During the time I loaded for a section, you may work on that section only.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:41.860]  If you finish a section before time is called, you may not go back to a previous section or on to the next one.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:45.680]  At this time, you have 30 minutes for section one.
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.560]  Open your test books and begin work.
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:49.180]  This is it.
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:49.740]  Yeah.
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:54.180]  This is it.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:54.360]  Yeah.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:54.360]  This is it.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:54.360]  Yeah.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:54.360]  This is it.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:54.360]  Yeah.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:54.360]  This is it.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:54.540]  I can't.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.340]  This is it.
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:02.480]  Damn.
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:06.480]  Baby got more cakes than ducking eyes, man.
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:06.940]  Damn.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:08.840]  Yeah.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:10.860]  Bet you about it, chip?
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:11.780]  Yeah.
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:11.840]  Yeah.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:11.840]  Yeah.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:11.840]  Yeah.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:11.840]  Yeah.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:11.840]  Yeah.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.720]  Tell them not to worry about the interest rate.
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:16.420]  The interest rate hasn't moved 2% in five years.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:18.600]  Few percent?
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:19.140]  Five.
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:19.920]  Come if you'll later.
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:28.180]  So, how you guys think you did on the test?
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.700]  All right, I guess.
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:31.020]  Yes.
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.520]  Most of those tests are culturally biased to begin with.
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:38.140]  The only part is universal is a math.
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.440]  You boys must be hungry.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.080]  I'm real surprised to see you down here.
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.220]  I came to see you.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.100]  See how you're doing.
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:49.500]  How's business going?
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.140]  Well, there's always business.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.860]  You're just not always in here.
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:55.380]  It's like what do you do, Furious?
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:56.560]  I mean, what?
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.220]  You help people get money for their homes or what?
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:01.280]  Well, there is no or what.
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.160]  That's what I do, Rick.
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.180]  You boys want to see something?
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:10.220]  Do we have a choice?
[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:14.660]  Nope.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.020]  I told you that, he'll help.
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:54.660]  Hey, man, I don't know about all this, Furious.
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.580]  You guys walk around my fucking compound doing all that.
[01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:00.920]  Rick, it's the 90s.
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:03.480]  I can't afford to be afraid of all the people anymore, Matt.
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.280]  Would you two knock on hands, come on?
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.320]  What y'all take a look at that sign up there?
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.080]  See what it says?
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:20.140]  Cash for your home?
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.240]  You know what that is?
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.340]  It's Bill Bell for it.
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.520]  What are y'all famous and Andy?
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.080]  Are you stepping in?
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:29.680]  He's fetches?
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:32.260]  I'm talking about the message what it stands for.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.160]  It's called gentrification.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:38.540]  That's what happens when the property value of a certain area
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:39.460]  is brought down.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:40.880]  Huh?
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:42.120]  You listening?
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:42.480]  Yeah.
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.220]  You're going to bring the property value down.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.840]  They can buy the land at a lower price
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.360]  than they move all the people out,
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.900]  raise the property value and sell it at a profit.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.500]  Now, what we need to do is we need to keep everything
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.720]  in our neighborhood, everything, black,
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:58.240]  black owned with black money,
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:01.320]  just like the Jews, the Italians, the Mexicans,
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.140]  and the Koreans do.
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.600]  Hey, nobody from outside bringing down the property value.
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:07.460]  It's these folks,
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:12.300]  shoot me to the end, selling that crack rock and shit.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:14.780]  Well, how you think the crack rock gets into the country?
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:16.020]  We don't own any planes,
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.000]  we don't own no ships,
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.000]  but we are not the people who are flying
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.540]  and floating that shit in here.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.000]  I know every time you turn on a TV,
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.200]  that's what you see, black people selling the rock,
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.180]  pushing the rock, pushing the rock.
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:30.860]  Yeah, I know.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:34.100]  But that wasn't a problem as long as it was here.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.580]  It wasn't a problem until it was in Iowa
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:39.820]  and it showed up on Wall Street where there are hardly any black people.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.060]  Now, if you want to talk about guns,
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:46.120]  why is it that there's a gun shop on almost every corner in this community?
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:46.440]  Why?
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:47.900]  Tell you why.
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:53.020]  But the same reason that there's a liquor store on almost every corner in the black community.
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:53.460]  Why?
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:54.980]  They want us to kill ourselves.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:56.640]  You go out to Beverly Hills,
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:57.660]  you don't see that shit,
[01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:59.980]  but they want us to kill ourselves.
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.940]  Yeah, the best way you can destroy your people
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:05.040]  you take away their ability to reproduce themselves.
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:05.360]  Yeah.
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:08.400]  Who is it that's dying out here on these streets every night?
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:10.020]  Y'all.
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:11.620]  Yeah.
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:13.680]  Young brothers like yourselves.
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:15.340]  What am I supposed to do?
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.420]  Full roll up, try to smoke me,
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.160]  and shoot the motherfucker if he don't kill me first.
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:22.520]  You're doing exactly what they want you to do.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:26.000]  You have to think, young brother, about your future.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:27.060]  Huh?
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.220]  Damn, man, you know, furious is deep.
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.200]  He used to be a preacher or something.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.920]  Nah, he never been a preacher.
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.140]  Just reads a lot.
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:41.260]  My brother should have heard that, man.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.860]  You know what, that ain't some good.
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:45.060]  Where are you?
[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:46.540]  Well, man.
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.820]  I'm on cringes, y'all, with the rest of the booze.
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:51.420]  Let's go?
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:52.120]  Go.
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:52.460]  Who?
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:56.860]  You know the shit got some stuff.
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:58.260]  But believe me,
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.200]  but now we live again.
[01:07:00.210 --> 01:07:03.890]  A gang of motherfuckers lives going in, but you know
[01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:06.270]  if they lucky they will know how to get away.
[01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:09.210]  The mill lives the fuck got another day.
[01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:11.410]  But in my room when I say that,
[01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:14.110]  hell, y'all, get the homie know from later.
[01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.770]  And y'all know exactly what they're doing.
[01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:21.350]  What up, nigga?
[01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:24.630]  Goddamn it, a lot of motherfuckers out here.
[01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:26.310]  Nigga, don't be using God's name in vain.
[01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.610]  What?
[01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:29.250]  That's shut.
[01:07:30.810 --> 01:07:32.130]  Yo, man, you believe in God?
[01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:35.950]  Yo, why the fuck y'all getting so damn religious, five days?
[01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:38.650]  Fool, I wasn't even talking to you.
[01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:40.790]  This is an A&B conversation, you know.
[01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.130]  You can see your way out of it.
[01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:44.790]  Yeah, you can see your way out my rock.
[01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:47.930]  I will see your cripple ass walking all the way home.
[01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:49.770]  Man, look, do I believe in God?
[01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:51.350]  Yeah, I guess I do.
[01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:54.170]  Hells, can you have the sun in the moon and the stars?
[01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:54.990]  It's shit like that.
[01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:59.650]  Sun, moon, stars, quasars, motherfuckers sound like air wood jets.
[01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:01.050]  Ain't no God.
[01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:03.770]  Okay, that was a God.
[01:08:04.110 --> 01:08:06.210]  Why'd he let motherfuckers get smoked every night?
[01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:10.150]  Babies and little kids, you tell me that.
[01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:11.990]  Well, you tell me this, nigga?
[01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:13.470]  How you know guys are hate?
[01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:15.630]  He could be a shit, you don't know that.
[01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:19.270]  For one thing, you don't know what the fuck I be motherfucking known.
[01:08:20.050 --> 01:08:22.090]  I read about this shit when I was in the pain.
[01:08:22.690 --> 01:08:23.710]  It was this book, right?
[01:08:24.190 --> 01:08:29.730]  And it was telling, life and a perspective, if God was a bitch,
[01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:34.410]  said if God was a bitch, there wouldn't be no nuclear bombs, no wars,
[01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:37.390]  no shit like that, because they ain't in a bitch's nature.
[01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:42.010]  Why every time you talk about a female, you gotta say bitch, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:43.430]  Because that's what you want.
[01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:44.430]  You never fuck you.
[01:08:54.570 --> 01:08:55.530]  Hey, what's up?
[01:08:56.230 --> 01:08:56.930]  What up, dude?
[01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:14.310]  What's up, mom?
[01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:15.530]  Something real crazy.
[01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:16.190]  I'm gonna go down there.
[01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:19.930]  I should go to here.
[01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:21.170]  What up, yeah?
[01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.690]  What's that?
[01:09:21.930 --> 01:09:24.070]  We all coming from Compton.
[01:09:24.570 --> 01:09:25.450]  What y'all doing over here, man?
[01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:27.390]  We're just kicking it.
[01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:30.930]  Lots of the size of God, church, pictures, and all.
[01:09:31.690 --> 01:09:34.690]  School and these niggas on the aspect of the glitch.
[01:09:35.230 --> 01:09:38.710]  The glitch you and all the factual, actual studies you know,
[01:09:38.790 --> 01:09:39.190]  I'm saying.
[01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:41.690]  Y'all coming from Compton?
[01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:42.110]  Yeah.
[01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:44.250]  I thought you were scared of Compton, man.
[01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:46.470]  Rick was a shivering bitch, boy.
[01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:47.830]  It was deep, though.
[01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:49.510]  Deep shit in there, man.
[01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:52.450]  Yeah, pop was talking, speaking, man.
[01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:53.610]  Speaking of truth and shit.
[01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:56.570]  Pop's like all the fucking mouth-crumbs.
[01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:57.270]  Faricana.
[01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:59.110]  I'm Faricana.
[01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:13.230]  Hey, man, what's wrong, Choo?
[01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:16.810]  Fuck you looking at, nigga.
[01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:18.910]  I'm still trying to find out, nigga.
[01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:20.110]  Hold on.
[01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:22.110]  Oh, we got a problem here.
[01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:24.890]  We got a problem here.
[01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:26.510]  We got a problem here.
[01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.570]  We got a problem here.
[01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:27.610]  What up with this?
[01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:28.990]  Going away, nigga.
[01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:31.250]  Can we have one night with her and don't find nobody.
[01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:31.730]  Get shot.
[01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:33.250]  Shut up, bitch.
[01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:34.390]  Bitch, I want fuck.

[01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:41.510]  Let's go.
[01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:43.170]  Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
[01:10:43.170 --> 01:10:43.910]  That was a sucker.
[01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.870]  We ain't fucking.
[01:10:45.370 --> 01:10:45.670]  What the fuck?
[01:10:46.090 --> 01:10:46.790]  Get the fuck out of here.
[01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:49.850]  Get the fuck out of here.
[01:10:50.190 --> 01:10:50.470]  Get the fuck out of here.
[01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:51.850]  Get the fuck out of here.
[01:10:54.670 --> 01:10:56.590]  Faricana, it's always trying to start some shit.
[01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:59.370]  Niggas can't even fight, so we always trying to find something.

[01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:03.350]  That's why food can get shot all the time.
[01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:06.170]  Trying to show our hard day.
[01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:07.690]  Ignorant?
[01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:08.630]  Aw, bitch.
[01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:09.410]  Shut up.

[01:11:10.730 --> 01:11:10.870]  That's what the fuck you do.
[01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.590]  I know.
[01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:15.250]  Yeah, dude, no, no.
[01:11:15.890 --> 01:11:16.550]  Yeah.
[01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:18.230]  What's going on?
[01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:18.230]  Fuck.
[01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:18.550]  No, no.
[01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.930]  No, man, no.
[01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:20.170]  No, no!
[01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:22.550]  No, man!
[01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.550]  No, no!
[01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:23.230]  Come on.
[01:11:23.230 --> 01:11:24.090]  Come on.
[01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:24.090]  Fuck you.
[01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:25.190]  Fuck you.

[01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:26.490]  Fuck you.
[01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.510]  Fuck you.
[01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:30.150]  Fuck you, no, no.
[01:11:31.810 --> 01:11:32.470]  Stop.
[01:11:33.670 --> 01:11:34.770]  Hit him in the hole.
[01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:35.170]  Let's go.
[01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:38.210]  Help me.
[01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:40.390]  Shit!
[01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:41.330]  Shit!
[01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:44.310]  I'm getting the fuck out of LA.
[01:11:45.650 --> 01:11:47.350]  Fuck this shit. Fuck it.
[01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:51.590]  We can't go nowhere without a getting all shut up shit.
[01:11:57.330 --> 01:11:57.850]  Shit.
[01:11:58.330 --> 01:11:58.850]  Shit.

[01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:07.230]  Driver!
[01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:09.210]  Put your hands on the steering wheel.
[01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:17.130]  Shit.
[01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:30.530]  Do I need drugs or weapons on you?
[01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:31.010]  No.
[01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:35.950]  I didn't do nothing.
[01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:38.730]  You think you're tough?
[01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:41.890]  You think you're tough, huh?
[01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:43.970]  You're doing good last time.
[01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:44.670]  Oh.
[01:12:46.150 --> 01:12:47.890]  You scared me, huh?
[01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:49.670]  I like that.
[01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:52.130]  That's what took this job.
[01:12:53.610 --> 01:12:55.730]  Or hate loom, or the fuckers like you.
[01:12:58.670 --> 01:13:00.310]  Lo, you're negligible in your shit.
[01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:02.730]  Think you're tough, huh?
[01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:02.790]  No.
[01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:05.930]  Blow your head off this myth or wasn't it?
[01:13:05.970 --> 01:13:06.950]  You couldn't do shit.
[01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:08.830]  How you feel now?
[01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:12.690]  What's searching for them?
[01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:14.530]  Look like one of them.
[01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:16.350]  Critch or Martha and motherfuckers.
[01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:19.930]  No, you probably won in roll in 60s, huh?
[01:13:21.610 --> 01:13:21.790]  Huh?
[01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:27.270]  Well, then, in 63, we have a possible 187 in movie W.I.P.
[01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:28.370]  Corner, Florence and Ron.
[01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:33.610]  Again, a possible 187 in movie W.I.P.
[01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:35.110]  Corner, Florence and Ron.
[01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:36.490]  Stay out of trouble.
[01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:39.250]  Your job will have a nice evening, huh?
[01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:40.030]  Yeah.
[01:14:15.370 --> 01:14:15.970]  You're late.
[01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:17.490]  I thought something might happen to you.
[01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:18.850]  Nothing gonna happen to me.
[01:14:20.010 --> 01:14:20.430]  It's...
[01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:23.450]  I'm tired of hearing them shooting all the time.
[01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:28.970]  It's wrong.
[01:14:33.090 --> 01:14:34.870]  I'm tired of the shit.
[01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:42.490]  You are his motherfuckers.
[01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:44.690]  Sick, sick, sick, fucking tired of you.
[01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:46.110]  Sick, sick of you.
[01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:47.110]  Sick of you.
[01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:48.770]  You're so fucking tired of this.
[01:14:49.090 --> 01:14:50.710]  Shit, fucking shit.
[01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:54.470]  Don't leave me motherfuckin' fucking fucking fucking tired of you.
[01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:54.770]  You're so fucking tired of this.
[01:14:55.010 --> 01:14:56.890]  Holy cow, are you not a fucker?
[01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:59.310]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, fucker.
[01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:36.110]  Uh...
[01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:37.390]  Shit.
[01:15:45.630 --> 01:15:47.150]  So fucking...
[01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:51.030]  I never thought I'd be crying in front of a female.
[01:15:54.010 --> 01:15:55.910]  You can cry in front of me.
[01:16:24.570 --> 01:16:25.090]  Shit.
[01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:27.030]  Anything about that?
[01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:29.870]  People getting married while they're still in college.
[01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:33.710]  What are you trying to ask me something?
[01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.870]  Oh.
[01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:38.970]  I just wanted to know what you thought about that kind of situation.
[01:16:41.370 --> 01:16:42.770]  I think it can be good.
[01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:45.510]  The two people really love each other.
[01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.510]  Really?
[01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:50.470]  Yeah.
[01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:56.150]  I'll show you how it is.
[01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:58.210]  Yeah.
[01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:59.510]  For you?
[01:17:00.090 --> 01:17:00.470]  Yeah.
[01:17:01.630 --> 01:17:04.190]  I mean, yes, I am.
[01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:11.590]  I don't want to get pregnant.
[01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:13.970]  You won't.
[01:17:50.490 --> 01:17:51.210]  Hi.
[01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:52.930]  We'll look you for a misdevil rope.
[01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:54.250]  She's right over there.
[01:17:54.610 --> 01:17:54.970]  Thank you.
[01:17:56.250 --> 01:17:57.190]  I agree.
[01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:06.850]  You look nice.
[01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:14.110]  Thank you.
[01:18:15.450 --> 01:18:16.170]  Thanks.
[01:18:16.170 --> 01:18:18.090]  Thanks for coming.
[01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:24.290]  So this is, uh...
[01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:25.370]  This is definitely you.
[01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:30.370]  And what that's supposed to mean, hm?
[01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:33.230]  I thought we were going to talk about Tray.
[01:18:36.850 --> 01:18:37.610]  Um...expressor, please.
[01:18:38.230 --> 01:18:38.950]  Cafe over there.
[01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:44.790]  I bought in some shoes yesterday.
[01:18:46.210 --> 01:18:47.830]  Why are you always buying him stuff?
[01:18:48.650 --> 01:18:49.930]  Can I be nice to my son?
[01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:51.450]  Do I have that right?
[01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:54.110]  Yes, you have that right, but he has a job.
[01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:55.790]  You don't have to always buy him stuff.
[01:18:56.130 --> 01:18:56.130]  Look.
[01:18:57.530 --> 01:18:59.890]  Did he tell you he wants to move in with Brandy when it goes to school?
[01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.590]  Yeah.
[01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:01.370]  So?
[01:19:03.190 --> 01:19:03.590]  Yeah.
[01:19:04.090 --> 01:19:04.490]  So?
[01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:07.350]  So don't you think that's a bad idea?
[01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.470]  Yeah.
[01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:16.950]  I think that Tray is old enough to make his own decisions, Riva.
[01:19:18.090 --> 01:19:18.870]  You're his father.
[01:19:19.570 --> 01:19:22.010]  That means he was supposed to guide his decisions.
[01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:25.350]  What the hell? You think I've been doing for the last seven years?
[01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:26.450]  Not that, ever, Dad.
[01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:27.410]  Listen, Riva.
[01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:30.750]  It's time for you to let go.
[01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:33.050]  I know you want to play the mommy and all of that,
[01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:35.230]  but Tray is a grown man now.
[01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:36.610]  He is not a little boy anymore.
[01:19:37.330 --> 01:19:39.390]  That time has passed, sweetheart. You missed it.
[01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:44.030]  Excuse me, I want to get some cigarettes.
[01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:46.830]  No, you're not getting off that easy. Sit your ass down.
[01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:48.890]  Excuse me?
[01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:53.450]  I said sit your ass down before I raise my voice and make a fool out of both of us.
[01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:02.650]  Now, it's my time to talk.
[01:20:03.970 --> 01:20:07.050]  Of course you took in your son, my son.
[01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:08.750]  Our son.
[01:20:09.650 --> 01:20:11.690]  And you taught him what he needed to be a man.
[01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:15.230]  I'll give you that, because most men ain't man enough to do what you did.
[01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:19.350]  But that gives you no reason.
[01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:24.870]  Do you hear me? No reason to tell me that I can't be a mother to my son.
[01:20:26.330 --> 01:20:32.630]  What you did is no different from what mothers have been doing from the beginning of the day.
[01:20:33.730 --> 01:20:36.250]  It's just too bad more brothers won't do the same.
[01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:38.910]  But don't think you're special.
[01:20:40.210 --> 01:20:43.390]  You may be cute, but not special.
[01:20:46.230 --> 01:20:48.010]  Drink your cafe, old lady. It's on me.
[01:20:53.210 --> 01:20:54.770]  Everybody in the mall was running.
[01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:57.970]  Love fuckers, bitches running out of our temple with their shit.
[01:20:59.090 --> 01:21:01.050]  Don't want cookies out of the cookie shop, motherfucker.
[01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:04.330]  Niggas was getting a bill on how smokey every month, fucking that came in.
[01:21:04.570 --> 01:21:05.890]  Every month, fucking came my way.
[01:21:06.230 --> 01:21:07.610]  I just thought I let y'all know that.
[01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:09.990]  See, I give a man that's fuck. Understands me?
[01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.650]  What's up?
[01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:11.370]  What's up, man?
[01:21:11.530 --> 01:21:13.110]  You messing all out. Think it's getting smoked?
[01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:14.770]  That's it. Think it's getting that cap feel.
[01:21:25.970 --> 01:21:26.730]  Who's in there?
[01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:27.610]  Who's in there?
[01:21:27.610 --> 01:21:28.390]  Man, pick Chris up.
[01:21:29.410 --> 01:21:30.950]  Pop my star tripping.
[01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:33.150]  Masterful to Chris up.
[01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:35.550]  Hey, I even got my gap.
[01:21:46.210 --> 01:21:48.430]  Punk motherfucker ain't got nothing better to do.
[01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:51.670]  27 years old, I'm still fucking motherfucker's old age.
[01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:53.090]  It's old age.
[01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.850]  What's up?
[01:21:55.870 --> 01:22:00.150]  Anyway, it's like you're wearing our brandy crib around 20 motherfucking monies.
[01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:00.750]  What's up with that?
[01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:02.970]  You know, man, that's my business.
[01:22:03.610 --> 01:22:03.810]  Yeah.
[01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:06.350]  How you just shit, jee?
[01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:07.290]  Pay a price of money.
[01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:08.270]  How you doing shit?
[01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:09.210]  Pay a price.
[01:22:09.450 --> 01:22:10.650]  Don't be like this motherfucker.
[01:22:11.670 --> 01:22:12.910]  Smutfucka got babies.
[01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:14.730]  And how's pussy?
[01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:19.050]  Let me just shit like that, my mom's gonna be like, I ain't having.
[01:22:20.690 --> 01:22:21.190]  Ricky.
[01:22:22.650 --> 01:22:23.150]  Ricky.
[01:22:24.730 --> 01:22:26.210]  You know you heard me.
[01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:26.910]  Huh?
[01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:27.470]  What?
[01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:30.130]  I need you to go to the store to get some corn, man.
[01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:31.130]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:34.930 --> 01:22:37.210]  If you want to land a good job,
[01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:39.890]  you have to know what most employers want.
[01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:42.310]  Like how to motivate yourself.
[01:22:42.890 --> 01:22:43.950]  How to lead others.
[01:22:44.770 --> 01:22:46.250]  How to perform under pressure.
[01:22:47.050 --> 01:22:49.250]  You can learn all these things in the army.
[01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:51.410]  So no matter what career you choose,
[01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:54.770]  you'll really be ready to take off.
[01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:59.710]  Ricky, get up and go now.
[01:23:00.370 --> 01:23:02.190]  I can't finish fire the fish without it.
[01:23:02.730 --> 01:23:05.750]  Boy, go get this girl some corn, man.
[01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:09.450]  Shoot, do you want to be happy somebody's cooking for your ass?
[01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:10.830]  Give me time to do that.

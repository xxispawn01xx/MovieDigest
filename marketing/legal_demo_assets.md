### Email Template 3: Competitive Intelligence

Hi [Attorney Name],

I noticed [Competing Firm] just won a significant [Case Type] verdict.

One competitive advantage they're using: AI-powered deposition analysis that identifies expert witness weaknesses and case patterns other firms miss.

Example: They found contradictory expert testimony from 3 previous cases that opposing counsel's expert had given. Case over.

Worth 15 minutes to see how this pattern recognition works on actual legal videos?

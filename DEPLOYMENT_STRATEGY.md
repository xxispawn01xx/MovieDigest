# MovieDigest AI - Deployment Strategy for Offline Video Analysis

## The Challenge: Serving Offline Tools Online

Your video summarization tool is designed for offline processing (data security, GPU acceleration, large file handling), but customers need easy access and deployment. Here are proven strategies:

## Deployment Model 1: Hybrid SaaS + Local Processing

### Architecture
- **Web Dashboard**: Hosted on Replit for campaign management, billing, updates
- **Local Client**: Downloadable desktop application for video processing
- **Sync Bridge**: Secure connection for settings, results export, licensing

### Benefits
- Customers get web-based account management and email marketing tools
- Video processing stays completely local and private
- Easy licensing and subscription management
- Automatic updates through web interface

### Implementation

# Overview

The Video Summarization Engine is an offline, GPU-accelerated application for processing movies and generating intelligent summaries with narrative analysis. The system discovers video files, extracts scenes using computer vision, transcribes audio using Whisper, analyzes narrative structure with local LLMs, and creates summaries with VLC bookmarks for easy navigation. Built with Streamlit for the web interface, it emphasizes local processing without external API dependencies.

# Recent Changes

## Latest Updates (Aug 6, 2025)
- **Adaptive Compression System**: Implemented smart compression ratios - 15% for videos â‰¤90 minutes, 20% for longer videos to maintain better narrative flow
- **Critical Summarization Fixes**: Fixed core issues preventing proper video summarization including scene selection validation, FFmpeg command optimization, and strict compression enforcement
- **Video Seeking Fix**: Implemented proper FFmpeg concatenation with faststart flag and timestamp reset for seeking compatibility
- **Streamlit Navigation Fix**: Replaced problematic st.switch_page calls with st.rerun to prevent app crashes
- **Scene Selection Enhancement**: Added validation to prevent invalid scene data and ensure proper duration constraints
- **Error Handling Improvement**: Eliminated fallback video copying that was causing full-length outputs instead of summaries
- **Windows Unicode Fix**: Resolved Windows Command Prompt encoding issues with RTX 3060 configuration detection
- **RTX 3060 Optimization**: Created smart environment detection system that automatically configures for RTX 3060 when running locally vs CPU fallback on Replit cloud

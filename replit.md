# Overview

The Video Summarization Engine is an offline, GPU-accelerated application for processing movies and generating intelligent summaries with narrative analysis. The system discovers video files, extracts scenes using computer vision, transcribes audio using Whisper, analyzes narrative structure with local LLMs, and creates summaries with VLC bookmarks for easy navigation. Built with Streamlit for the web interface, it emphasizes local processing without external API dependencies.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Preferred LLM models: Mistral (uncensored) over traditional models like DialoGPT.

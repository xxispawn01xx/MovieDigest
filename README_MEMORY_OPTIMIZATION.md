# CUDA Memory Optimization Guide

## Overview

MovieDigest AI includes comprehensive CUDA memory management to prevent out-of-memory errors during sustained video processing. The system is optimized for RTX 3060 (12.9GB VRAM) but adapts to different GPU configurations.

## Memory Management Features

### Intelligent Memory Pressure Detection
- **Real-time monitoring** of VRAM usage with automatic response
- **Threshold-based actions**:
  - 70% usage → Standard cleanup
  - 80% usage → Aggressive cleanup  
  - 90% usage → Emergency cleanup + processing pause

### Multi-Tier Cleanup System
1. **Standard Cleanup**: PyTorch cache clearing and CUDA synchronization
2. **Aggressive Cleanup**: Deep memory cleanup with Python garbage collection and memory stats reset
3. **Emergency Cleanup**: Complete memory reset with multiple cache clearing passes

### CUDA Out-of-Memory Recovery
- **Automatic detection** of OOM errors during processing
- **Emergency recovery** with memory cleanup and reduced settings
- **Fallback processing** with 75% reduced batch sizes
- **Continuous processing** - system continues with remaining videos after recovery

## Recommended Batch Sizes

### RTX 3060 (12.9GB VRAM)
```
Video Batch Processing:
- Large movies (2+ hours): 1 video per batch
- Standard movies (90-120 min): 2 videos per batch  
- Short videos (<90 min): 2-3 videos per batch

Whisper Transcription:
- Conservative: 4-6 chunks per batch
- Emergency mode: 2-4 chunks per batch

LLM Processing:
- Conservative: 2-4 batches
- Emergency mode: 1-2 batches
```

### Memory Usage Guidelines
- **Target VRAM Usage**: 85% maximum (11GB on RTX 3060)
- **System Reserve**: 1.9GB for Windows/drivers
- **Processing Buffer**: 10-15% overhead for temporary allocations

## Configuration Files

### RTX 3060 Optimized Settings (`config_rtx3060.py`)
```python
# Conservative batch sizes for stability
DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE = 2          # Video processing
MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 3              # Maximum videos per batch
WHISPER_BATCH_SIZE = 8          # Whisper transcription
LLM_BATCH_SIZE = 4              # LLM narrative analysis
MAX_GPU_MEMORY_GB = 11.0        # VRAM allocation limit
GPU_MEMORY_FRACTION = 0.85      # 85% VRAM usage
```

### Adaptive Batch Sizing (`utils/adaptive_batch_sizing.py`)
- **Dynamic optimization** based on video characteristics
- **Memory estimation** using video duration, resolution, and frame count
- **Historical performance** tracking for optimal batch size recommendations
- **Conservative settings** during high memory pressure

## Memory Optimization Workflow

### Before Processing Each Video
1. **Check memory pressure** using GPU manager
2. **Apply appropriate cleanup** based on current usage
3. **Estimate video memory requirements** using adaptive sizer
4. **Adjust batch size** if necessary for memory safety

### During Processing
1. **Monitor VRAM usage** continuously
2. **Trigger cleanup** when thresholds exceeded  
3. **Handle OOM errors** with automatic recovery
4. **Continue processing** remaining videos after failures

### After Processing
1. **Cleanup memory** every 2 processed videos
2. **Update performance statistics** for future optimization
3. **Reset memory stats** for next batch

## Troubleshooting CUDA Memory Issues

### Common Symptoms
- "CUDA out of memory" errors
- System freezing during processing
- Inconsistent processing performance
- Memory allocation failures

### Solutions
1. **Reduce batch sizes** in configuration files
2. **Enable emergency mode** for problematic videos
3. **Use adaptive batch sizing** for automatic optimization
4. **Monitor memory usage** through GPU manager logs

### Emergency Recovery Steps
1. **Stop current processing** if system becomes unresponsive
2. **Restart application** to clear all GPU memory
3. **Reduce batch sizes** by 50% in configuration
4. **Process videos individually** for maximum stability

## Performance vs Memory Trade-offs

### High Performance (Risk of OOM)
- Video batch: 3-4 videos
- Whisper batch: 16 chunks
- LLM batch: 8 batches
- Best for: Short videos, powerful GPUs

### Balanced (Recommended)  
- Video batch: 2 videos
- Whisper batch: 6 chunks
- LLM batch: 4 batches
- Best for: Mixed video lengths, RTX 3060

### Maximum Stability (Slowest)
- Video batch: 1 video
- Whisper batch: 4 chunks  
- LLM batch: 2 batches
- Best for: Large movies, memory-constrained systems

## Monitoring and Logging

### GPU Memory Logs
```
INFO:utils.gpu_manager:Memory check: 8.2GB used, 2.1GB required, 4.7GB available
INFO:core.batch_processor:Medium memory pressure (72.1%) - performing standard cleanup
INFO:utils.gpu_manager:GPU memory optimization completed - Freed 1.8GB
```

### Performance Tracking
```
INFO:utils.adaptive_batch_sizing:Batch size 2 performance: 95.0% success, avg memory: 9.2GB
INFO:utils.adaptive_batch_sizing:Recommended batch size based on history: 2
```

## Integration with Enterprise Systems

The robust memory management system ensures:
